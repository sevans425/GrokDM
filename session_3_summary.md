     6	**The Grimoire Recovery**
     7	
     8	Session 3 opened with Eden waking at The Sleeping Bear Inn, fully rested after Session 2's exhausting multi-site operation. Mayor Blackwood and Captain Rorick met him at breakfast to discuss next steps: recovering the three stolen grimoires from Raven's Crag, interrogating the cultists, and handling the dangerous artifacts.
     9	
    10	Eden prioritized the grimoires, insisting they not leave supervision until secured. The party—Eden, Rorick, Sergeant Brickle, Thompson, and Miriam Crowsinger—departed within the hour for Raven's Crag, 10 miles northwest.
    11	
    12	Eden took time to summon a rat familiar using materials provided by Miriam (1 hour ritual). The familiar proved invaluable for cave scouting. Eden prepared combat spells (Magic Missile, Mage Armor, Shield, Sleep) and cast Mage Armor before entering.
    13	
    14	At Raven's Crag, Eden triggered the entrance's failing transmutation ward using a Light-enchanted pebble, revealing a partial collapse trap. Inside, his rat familiar scouted ahead and discovered a circular chamber with a stone pedestal holding a weathered wooden chest, surrounded by a 10-foot radius Flesh to Stone trap.
    15	
    16	**Clever Problem-Solving:** Eden sent the party back to the entrance for safety, then used a 100-foot rope with a slip knot to lasso the pedestal. Through sheer determination (Strength check 12), he dragged the heavy stone pedestal out of the trap radius, avoiding the petrification effect entirely. Physics over magic.
    17	
    18	The chest was secured and brought outside without triggering any traps.
    19	
    20	**Deception of Bhaal:** Recognizing the risk of the weakened Deathstalker entity still possessing Elara, Eden insisted on a critical operational security measure—they would interrogate Elara as if the chest was still in the cave, not reveal its true location. "We're not lying to her—we're lying to Bhaal."
    21	
    22	The interrogation succeeded. Elara believed the chest remained at Raven's Crag and provided the passphrase: "Death is the door, and I am the key." She warned that forcing the chest would trigger a psychic alarm through the Shadowfell to alert other Bhaal cultists.
    23	
    24	**Wilderness Opening:** Eden proposed riding half a day into wilderness (opposite direction from Raven's Crag), opening the chest at the furthest point to minimize danger to Thornhaven, and staging a false necromancer scene if the alarm triggered.
    25	
    26	The party rode 6 hours northwest into desolate moorlands. Eden spoke the passphrase over the chest lock, and it opened cleanly—no alarm triggered. Inside: three grimoires wrapped in oilcloth, exactly as Elara described.
    27	
    28	Eden cast Detect Magic (ritual) and verified their authenticity:
    29	- **The Shadowfell Concordat**: Strong necromancy/conjuration (shadow summoning, portals)
    30	- **Rites of the Dusk Court**: Strong illusion/enchantment (deception, domination)
    31	- **The Book of Anchors**: Strong abjuration/transmutation (planar anchor creation)
    32	
    33	Miriam staged a convincing false scene—scattered ritual components, disrupted ash circle, abandoned cloak—making it appear a panicked necromancer fled after looting the chest.
    34	
    35	The grimoires were secured in the iron lockbox with the ritual dagger, journal, and idol. Eden and Rorick maintained two-key security. The party returned to Thornhaven by sunset.
    36	
    37	**Session End:** Eden rested at The Sleeping Bear Inn. Tomorrow at dawn, the party departs for the capital with all prisoners, evidence, and artifacts—a three-day journey to present everything to the Royal Court and reunite Eden with his father, Aldrin Sagebough.
