---

## Tactical Signature

**Combat Style:**
- Information gathering over direct confrontation
- Misdirection and illusions (Minor Illusion, Disguise Self)
- Heavy ritual use (Detect Magic constantly active)
- Resource management (conserve spell slots, use items strategically)
- Team coordination (trust specialists, clear signals)
- Emergency contingency planning (Portent as backup, not foundation)

**Specializations:**
- Planar threat assessment
- Intelligence work and information architecture
- Divination magic and tactical prediction
- Multi-faction coordination
- Operational security and counter-surveillance

**Known Weaknesses:**
- Low HP (15 total, easily killed by serious threats)
- Limited spell slots (4 first, 2 second)
- No healing capability (relies on potions/allies)
- Physically fragile (STR 8, needs tactical advantage)
- Sleep-deprived (judgment compromised)
- Young and relatively inexperienced (compensates with preparation)

**Compensating Strengths:**
- Exceptional tactical thinking
- Information asymmetry exploitation
- Resource acquisition through mentors
- Psychological warfare and misdirection
- Adaptability under pressure
- Arranged conclusions methodology

---

## Professional Philosophy

**Self-Description:**
"A librarian. Putting information in the hands of people who need it."

**Operational Role:**
Not a warrior. Not a spy. An information broker/anchor point - facilitating coordination between power structures that don't normally communicate (Crown, Rookery, reformist exarchs).

**Independence as Power:**
Aldrin's advice: "Your independence is your power. Protect it."

Working with Crown, Rookery, Kethris faction, and Blackwater - but owned by none. Value comes from being neutral enough to work with anyone, committed enough to care about outcomes.

**Victory Philosophy:**
"Victory is victory. As long as it's acknowledged through the proper channels and it gets my team and I the resources we need when we need it, the pomp and circumstance is just extra."

Public celebration means discretion failed. Best victories are quiet.

---

## Character Notes

**Sleep Deprivation:**
Two weeks without more than 4 hours sleep while planning operations or processing crises. Age 20 - body can survive it, judgment can't. First mandatory rest period just ordered.

**Arranged Conclusions:**
Understanding that his capabilities were deliberately built by father over 20 years, but claiming agency in how he uses them. "Arranged opportunity, not arranged conclusion."

**Certainty Over Fear:**
Resistance to Vorthanis's supernatural terror came from certainty about purpose (duty, protecting vulnerable, preventing mass casualties), not absence of fear. The Weave responds to certainty as magical state.

**Resource Discipline:**
Asks for external rubrics to prevent rationalization. Knows tendency to optimize and squeeze every advantage. Requesting guardrails before gaining power to abuse.

**Professional Development:**
- Tormund: "Third-year thinking" / "Master-level approach"
- Displays advanced tactical thinking but still massive learning curve
- 20-year preparation validating while showing how much remains unknown
