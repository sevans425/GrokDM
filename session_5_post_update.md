    88	- Turned potential enemy (Tormund) into crucial ally within single conversation
    89	- Secured multiple powerful alliances (King, Temple, Archmage, Merchant)
    90	- Father's retirement secured
    91	- Clear boundaries set with Blackwater (integrity maintained)
    92	- Exhausting but overwhelmingly successful session
    93	
    94	## DM Notes

    96	- The Tormund rehabilitation strategy was player-initiated and brilliantly executed
    97	- High emotional/mental exhaustion appropriate - Eden has been "on" for entire day
    98	- Three cultists remain ongoing threat (potential Session 6 hook)
    99	- Transcription project provides long-term campaign structure
   100	- Political alliances create interesting tension/expectations for future sessions
