     3	## How This File Works
     4	
     5	**This file stores the current user's active campaign data.**
     6	
     7	Each user will have their own campaign with their own Google Sheet. When a user starts or continues a campaign, you should:
     8	1. Ask for their spreadsheet ID if not already stored here
     9	2. Update this file with their campaign information
    10	3. Use this file as the source of truth for the current user's campaign
    11
