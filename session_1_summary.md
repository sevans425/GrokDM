     4	## Session Recap
     5	
     6	Eden Sagebough, a high elf detective-wizard, arrived in the frontier logging town of Thornhaven to investigate a series of mysterious disappearances. Three townsfolk had been kidnapped over the past week: Old Gareth (elderly trapper), Lily Copperkettle (young woman, daughter of the local smith), and most recently Mara Thornwood (the mayor's niece, taken from her bed the night before).
     7	
     8	Eden met with the desperate Mayor Aldric Blackwood, who commissioned him to find the victims and provided emergency authority via his seal ring. Eden gathered supplies from Benna Cartwright (who generously gifted him a valuable pearl for his Identify spell) and investigated evidence at Torvald Copperkettle's smithy.
     9	
    10	Following clues into Whisperwood Forest, Eden, Torvald, and Captain Rorick discovered an abandoned logging camp deep in the woods. There they found a Shadowfell portal maintained by a crude stone idol covered in binding runes. The portal was being used by seven-foot-tall shadow creatures to kidnap townsfolk.
    11	
    12	In a fierce battle, Eden and his allies fought the shadow creatures. Two were killed (dissolving into oily shadow residue), and when a larger third creature emerged from the portal, Torvald smashed the stone idol anchor with his warhammer. The portal collapsed, sucking the remaining creature back into the Shadowfell. All three kidnapping victims were rescued alive, though traumatized.
    13	
    14	The party returned to Thornhaven as heroes. During celebration at The Sleeping Bear Tavern, Eden used his Identify spell on the shattered idol fragments and made a crucial discovery: the idol's creator used knowledge from grimoires stolen from the Royal Archives 20 years ago - the exact unsolved case his father Aldrin had written to him about. The creator was human, adult, desperate and afraid, but their identity remains unknown.

    44	## Plot Threads
    45	
    46	### Opened
    47	- **Unknown Idol Creator**: Someone in the region has the stolen grimoires and created the portal. They are still at large and their identity/location unknown
    48	- **Crown of Unity**: The protective artifact shattered ~3 weeks ago, weakening planar barriers across Aldoria Kingdom - this may be a kingdom-wide crisis
    49	- **Miriam the Crow-Keeper**: Hermit who has been warning about "shadow paths opening" - potential information source, not yet contacted
    50	- **Master Archivist Elara Moonshadow**: Covered up the grimoire theft 20 years ago, then disappeared (presumed dead) - her fate and motivations unclear
    51	
    52	### Advanced
    53	- **Father's Investigation**: Eden's father Aldrin's 20-year-old cold case is now directly relevant and connected to current crisis
    54	- **Shadowfell Incursion**: Portal is closed but threat may not be fully eliminated; larger creature escaped back to Shadowfell
    55	
    56	### Closed
    57	- **Thornhaven Kidnappings**: All three victims rescued, immediate portal threat eliminated
    58	- **Shadow Creatures in Whisperwood**: Immediate threat neutralized with portal closure
    59	
    60	## Character Development
    61	- Eden established himself as a competent investigator and hero
    62	- Strong bonds formed with Torvald (who saved his life) and Captain Rorick (combat ally)
    63	- Gained Mayor's complete trust and authority
    64	- Personal stakes raised: father's unsolved case is now Eden's active investigation
    65
