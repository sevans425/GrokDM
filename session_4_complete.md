    66	## Session 5 Opening Hook
    67	
    68	*The morning sun streams through the window of your guest room in your father's townhouse. You wake to the smell of breakfast cooking and the sound of your father moving about downstairs. Fang stretches beside you, whiskers twitching.*
    69	
    70	*Today you stand before the King of Aldoria.*
    71	
    72	*The grimoires that have haunted your father for twenty years will be formally presented. The cult you dismantled will face royal justice. And a second-level wizard from a small town will receive recognition for preventing an apocalypse.*
    73	
    74	*Your father's voice calls up the stairs: "Eden! Breakfast is ready. We should eat well—Court proceedings can take hours, and you'll want your strength."*
    75	
    76	*Through the window, you can see the royal palace rising on the central plateau, its banners snapping in the morning breeze.*
    77	
    78	*What do you do?*
