     9	## The Story So Far
    10	
    11	### Session 1: The Shadowfell Incursion
    12	Eden arrived in Thornhaven following his father's letter about a potential connection between stolen grimoires and current events. He discovered three townspeople had been kidnapped by shadow creatures through a planar rift. Working with Captain Rorick Stoneshield and Torvald Copperkettle, Eden closed the first rift at the old logging camp, rescued all three victims, and discovered a buried idol anchor was maintaining the portal. This was the cult's first ritual site.
    13	
    14	**Key NPCs**: Rorick Stoneshield, Torvald Copperkettle, Mayor Blackwood, Greta Ironfoot
    15	**Key Discovery**: Shadow creatures were *summoned*, not accidental—someone was deliberately opening portals
    16	
    17	### Session 2: The Multi-Site Strike
    18	Eden and Miriam Crowsinger (local hedge witch) discovered the cult was operating three simultaneous ritual sites forming a triangle around Thornhaven. Using intelligence, stealth, and tactical coordination, they conducted a lightning-strike operation:
    19	- Disrupted the standing stones ritual using illusions and stolen ritual components
    20	- Captured cult leader Elara Moonshadow (possessed by Bhaal entity) at the logging camp
    21	- Secured the watchtower site and captured remaining cultists
    22	- Total: 7 cultists captured, 3 sites warded against planar incursion
    23	- Prevented apocalyptic ritual that would have killed ~300 people by tearing the region into the Shadowfell
    24	
    25	**Key NPCs**: Miriam Crowsinger, Elara Moonshadow (cult leader), Sergeant Brickle, Thompson
    26	**Key Discovery**: Cult led by former Master Archivist Elara, possessed by Bhaal's "Deathstalker" entity
    27	
    28	### Session 3: The Grimoire Recovery
    29	Through interrogation, Eden learned Elara had stolen three grimoires from the Royal Archives in Year 1284—the very case his father had investigated for 20 years. Using clever deception and operational security:
    30	- Located grimoires hidden in Raven's Crag caves
    31	- Bypassed deadly Flesh to Stone trap using physics (rope + pedestal drag)
    32	- Deceived Bhaal by claiming chest was still in cave during interrogation
    33	- Opened chest in wilderness using passphrase, verified all three grimoires authentic
    34	- Staged false necromancer scene to misdirect any divine attention
    35	- Secured all artifacts in iron lockbox with two-key system
    36	
    37	**Key Items**: The Shadowfell Concordat, Rites of the Dusk Court, The Book of Anchors (grimoires); Ritual Dagger; Elara's Journal; Idol Anchor
    38	**Key Achievement**: Solved father's 20-year case in three days
    39	
    40	### Session 4: The Road to the Capital
    41	Eden executed a brilliant security strategy for transporting dangerous artifacts:
    42	- Split party: prisoners via main road (decoy), lockbox via trader's road
    43	- Separated lockbox keys between both groups (impossible to open without both)
    44	- Discovered cultist staging ground and murdered merchant
    45	- Detected ambush ahead using familiar + crows (layered reconnaissance)
    46	- Bypassed ambush through forest without engaging—pure tactical victory
    47	- Forced march through night, arrived capital Day 3
    48	- Delivered lockbox to City Guard vault under double guard
    49	- Provided comprehensive testimony to Captain Thorne and officials
    50	- **EMOTIONAL REUNION**: Met father Aldrin Sagebough, resolved his 20-year obsession
    51	- Royal Court audience scheduled for next morning
    52	
    53	**Key NPCs**: Captain Thorne, Aldrin Sagebough (father), Magistrate Kellan, Priestess Lyra
    54	**Key Achievement**: Six victories over Bhaal cult, zero defeats
