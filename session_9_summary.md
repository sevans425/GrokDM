# Session 9 Summary
**Campaign**: The Thornhaven Shadow Crisis (Royal Court Arc)  
**Session Date**: 2026-02-17  
**In-Game Date**: Day 7 (fourth bell breach through evening)  
**Session Length**: Full combat and extraction operation

---

## Session Recap

Session 9 was the culmination of 8 sessions of preparation: a Lower Planes pocket realm extraction operation against a sixth-level exarch, executed with precision, creativity, and a nat 20 when it mattered most. Eden led a joint Crown-Rookery team into Vorthanis the Rendered's domain, extracted Kethris Mournshadow against impossible odds, and saved 4,000+ lives in an operation that will never be publicly acknowledged.

### The Breach (Fourth Bell, Day 7)

**Team Composition:**
- Eden Sagebough (Frontline) - Level 2 wizard, disguised as Kethris
- Miriam Crowsinger (Support) - 10 feet behind, defensive magic
- Carr (Extraction) - Right flank, ready to grab Kethris
- Devin (Anchor) - Entry point, crystalline beacon to track threshold
- Vane (Tactical Support) - Left flank, smoke and flash deployment
- Lyren Ashveil (Inside Asset) - Room 9, holding Subject Two
- Brecht (This-Side Anchor) - Commanding from corridor
- Whisper (Intelligence/Proof) - In Eden's pocket, verification protocol

**Initial Situation - Room 9:**
- Three occupants: Subject One (aggressive), Subject Two (nervous), Lyren (waiting)
- Active threshold circle (blood, ash, Lower Planes residue)
- Room geometry already distorting (space feels wrong)
- Lyren positioned between cultists and threshold

### Round 1: First Contact

   - Glowing blue = threshold stable
   - Magic Missile at Subject One (11 damage)

3. Carr (15) - Positioned for extraction
   - Right flank, line of sight to threshold

4. Subject Two (14) - Accelerated threshold opening
   - Kneeling at circle, chanting
   - Circle pulsing with power
   - Trying to force manifestation

   - "Sagebough, DOWN!"
   - Force explosion over Eden's head
   - Subject One: CON save 8 vs DC 14 - FAIL
   - 11 damage, thrown into wall, UNCONSCIOUS/DEAD

6. Vane (11) - Threat assessment
   - "*Threshold's opening. 60 seconds, maybe less.*"
   - Two smoke pellets ready
   - Waiting for Eden's call

7. Lyren (8) - Critical choice moment
   - Saw Whisper in Eden's hand
   - "*Where is she? Where's my mother?*"
   - Dagger up, pointing at Subject Two
   - Waiting to see whose side to take

8. **Eden (4)** - "*BREACH!*"

---

### The Pocket Realm Opens

Vane's smoke pellets deployed. 25-30 feet forward, creating 15-foot wall of obscurement.

**The threshold RIPPED OPEN.**

**Environment Description:**
- 40-foot diameter hole in reality
- Sky: purple/black/sickly yellow (bruised colors)
- Ground: cracked stone that breathes
- Air: shimmers with heat despite freezing temperature
- Geometry: fundamentally wrong, hurts to perceive
- Distance: elastic, unreliable

**Kethris Located:**
- 40 feet from threshold entry point
- Bound to vertical stone slab, arms spread
- Seven glowing purple marks (necrotic energy):
  - Left arm: shoulder, elbow, wrist (3)
  - Right arm: shoulder, wrist (2)
  - Chest: over heart (1)
  - Forehead: center (1)
- Conscious, barely
- Three days of torture evident

**Vorthanis the Rendered:**
- Positioned between entry and Kethris (~20 feet from each)
- 7-8 feet tall, flickering form
- Gray cracked skin like old parchment
- Empty eye sockets that still *see*
- Stained ceremonial robes
- Voice: beautiful, melodic, completely wrong
- "*Visitors. How unexpected. How delightful.*"

**Lyren's Choice:**
- Lunged at Subject Two
- Dagger to shoulder, broke his chanting
- "*You're coming with us or you're dying here. Choose.*"
- Subject Two: scrambled away, terrified, bleeding
- Lyren: committed to extraction team

---

### Round 2-3: Misdirection and Movement

**Eden's Tactical Sequence:**
1. **Disguise Self scroll** (popped at smoke wall edge)
   - Transformed into Kethris's appearance
   - Height, face, hair, tattered robes
   - Voice altered to match
   - Duration: 1 hour

2. **Minor Illusion** (sound only, 30-foot range)
   - Created scraping footstep sound
   - 25 feet behind Vorthanis, 10 feet left
   - Amateur stealth failure sound
   - Vorthanis turned to investigate

3. **Dash Action** (60 feet movement)
   - Sprinted for Kethris while Vorthanis looked away
   - Dropped smoke pellets at Kethris's feet on approach
   - New obscurement cloud: 20-foot diameter around binding slab
   - Outside Vorthanis's 60-foot truesight range

**Team Coordination:**
- Miriam cast Shield of Faith on Eden (AC 15→17)
- Carr circled right, positioning for extraction
- Devin maintained beacon watch (still blue/stable)
- Vane flanked left, flash powder ready
- Lyren entered threshold, saw mother, face went white→red→cold

**Vorthanis's Reaction:**
- Realized the approach sounds were illusion
- Spun back to binding slab
- Saw new smoke cloud
- "*Clever little mortal.*"
- Couldn't see what was happening inside smoke (physical obscurement blocks truesight outside 60-foot range)

---

### The Verification (Critical Moment)

Eden reached Kethris through smoke. Up close:
- Skin gray from torture
- Breathing shallow
- Seven binding marks carved (not tattooed), still bleeding
- Shaking from pain

Kethris saw "herself" approaching. Confusion.

Then Whisper climbed onto Eden's shoulder. **Recognition.**

**Whisper: Verification Question**
*"What did you say when you gave Lyren her sixteenth birthday gift?"*

**Kethris (barely audible, hoarse):**
*"I said 'this was your grandmother's. Now it's yours. Keep it sharp.'"*

**Whisper: One nudge. CORRECT.**

Kethris understood the disguise, the plan, the rescue attempt.

*"It's really you. You found— clever."*

Then immediately: *"Leave. Close the threshold. Don't—"*

**Vorthanis's voice through smoke:** *"How touching."*

Footsteps approaching. Five seconds to contact.

**Whisper:** *"Sleep her NOW or sever bindings fast. Choose."*

**Eden's response:** Dash action. Directly away from Vorthanis.

---

### Round 4-5: The Binding Break

**Eden's Misdirection:**
- Circled behind binding slab (60 feet from Vorthanis)
- Shouted: "*Who said anything about trying, jerk?*"
- Voice came out as Kethris's voice (disguise still active)
- Vorthanis: moment of doubt - "*Kethris?*"
- Fear aura activated (30-foot radius, CON DC 14)

**Eden: CON Save vs Fear**
- Natural 20
- Fear washed over him
- Acknowledged it
- **Stood anyway**
- Smiled at empty sockets: "*Yeah. He did.*" (referring to Aldrin)
- Vorthanis: *"Impossible."*
- Eden: "*I'm not resisting. I'm just not interested.*"

**The Assault Begins:**

**Lyren's Action (paralyzed by Hold Person initially):**
- Before paralysis: destroyed left shoulder binding mark
- Kethris **SCREAMED** (cauterization wound being reopened)
- 1 of 7 marks destroyed
- Vorthanis cast Hold Person on Lyren (WIS save: 9 vs DC 15 - paralyzed)

**Team Engagement:**
- Devin: Magic Missile (5 bolts, 18 damage to Vorthanis)
- Miriam: Spiritual Weapon (spectral hammer, 9 force damage)
- Vane: Smoke pellet at Vorthanis's feet (obscured his position)
- Lyren: WIS save (16) - **broke paralysis**, charged with dagger (5 damage)

**Eden's Turn:**
- **Dimensional Anchor Ward deployed**
- Thrown to Vorthanis's feet in smoke
- 30-foot radius anti-teleportation field
- Vorthanis tried Misty Step - **FAILED**
- Trapped in radius, can't reposition via magic

**Vorthanis Responds:**
- Legendary action: Chill Touch on Lyren (11 necrotic damage)
- *"The boy wizard. Do you know what I'm going to do when I'm done with you? I'm going to drag your father through this threshold."*
- Attempting psychological warfare
- Whisper: *"He's trying to bait you. Don't listen."*

**Round 6: The Chime**

**Devin:** Tanglefoot Bag
- Sticky adhesive at Vorthanis's feet
- Movement speed reduced to 0
- Can't advance on Eden

**Carr:** Extraction sprint
- Began moving toward Kethris
- Wide berth around stuck Vorthanis
- Dash action: 60 feet toward binding slab

**Miriam:** Spiritual Weapon (7 force damage)
- Positioned beside Eden protectively
- *"When you throw the Bead, we run. Understood?"*

**Eden's Action: CHIME OF OPENING**

Pulled silver chime from pouch. Rang it once.

**MAGICAL EFFECT - THREE BINDING MARKS SHATTERED:**
- Right arm: shoulder mark
- Right arm: wrist mark  
- Forehead: center mark
- Purple light bled out, necrotic energy dissipated

**Total marks destroyed: 4 of 7**
- Left shoulder (Lyren's dagger)
- Right shoulder (Chime)
- Right wrist (Chime)
- Forehead (Chime)

**THE BINDING BROKE.**

Remaining three marks (left elbow, left wrist, chest) flared purple then faded to dull gray. Inactive. Powerless.

Kethris gasped, collapsed forward (binding had been holding her up).

**Eden: "PULL!"**

**Carr:** "*Got her.*"
- Caught Kethris professionally
- "*Moving—*"
- Started extraction run

---

### Vorthanis's Counterplay

**Attempted Counterspell:** Already used reaction (defensive trigger from Devin's earlier hit) - **CAN'T COUNTER THE CHIME**

**Misty Step:** Bonus action teleport to block extraction route
- Appeared between Carr and threshold
- 30 feet from Carr, blocking path
- Empty sockets locked on Eden
- Truesight active: disguise **FAILED** (inside 60-foot range)
- Saw Eden for what he was: *"You. Aldrin Sagebough's little project."*

**Fear Aura:** CON save DC 14
- Eden already passed (Nat 20 earlier)
- Still standing, still certain

**Vorthanis recognized the situation:**
- Binding broken
- Kethris being extracted
- Team coordinated and effective
- His operation: failing

---

### Round 7-8: Containment

**Team Actions:**
- Devin: Ray of Frost (6 cold damage, speed reduced by 10)
- Miriam: Spiritual Weapon (9 force damage)
- Vane: Smoke pellet at Vorthanis's feet (10-foot obscurement)
- Lyren: WIS save successful, paralysis ended, dagger attack (5 piercing)
  - *"You don't get her."* (personal, defiant)

**Vorthanis:** *"Child. You should have stayed in that room."*

**Eden's Final Move: BEAD OF FORCE**

Pulled glass bead (barely larger than pearl). Sixth-level Academy artifact.

Threw it at ground beneath Vorthanis's stuck feet.

**WALL OF FORCE - SPHERE FORM:**
- 10-foot radius sphere (20-foot diameter)
- Pure force, translucent, shimmering
- Absolutely impenetrable
- Duration: 1 minute (60 seconds)
- Nothing can pass through (spells, attacks, people, nothing)

**Eden's Position:** 15 feet from impact point
- Sphere expanding to 10-foot radius
- DEX save DC 15 to avoid being trapped inside
- Roll: 13 + 3 DEX + 4 Bless = **20 (SUCCESS)**

**Result:**
- Eden dove backward
- Miriam grabbed his arm, yanked
- Sphere crystallized inches from Eden's face
- Eden outside, safe
- **Vorthanis inside, alone, trapped**

**Vorthanis's Response:**
- Fists slammed against inside of sphere (no sound penetrates)
- Mouth moving (beautiful obscenities inaudible)
- Trying spells (nothing penetrates sphere)
- Can only be ended by Disintegrate spell
- 60 seconds until freedom

Whisper: *"LEGENDARY. Kethris is going to love this story."*

---

### Pocket Realm Collapse

**Threshold Instability:**
- Realm shuddered (not violently, but wrong)
- Devin: *"Threshold's reacting! The binding anchor being broken is causing instability!"*
- Whisper: *"We have maybe two minutes before this realm starts collapsing. Everyone OUT. NOW."*

**Full Extraction Sequence:**

**Eden:** "*EVERYONE OUT! NOW!*"

**Order of Exit:**
1. **Carr** (carrying Kethris)
   - Crossed threshold first
   - Reality shift: purple hellscape → Room 9 boarding house
   - Laid Kethris down, checked vitals
   - *"Breathing. Pulse weak. She's alive."*

2. **Lyren**
   - Collapsed beside mother
   - Hands hovering over destroyed binding marks
   - *"Mom—"*
   - Kethris (barely conscious): *"Stupid girl. Should have... left me..."*
   - Lyren (sobbing): *"Shut up, Mom."*

3. **Devin**
   - Grabbed beacon (now glowing **RED**)
   - *"Thirty seconds to collapse!"*

4. **Vane**

5. **Miriam**

6. **Eden** (last out)
   - Looked back one final time
   - Pocket realm: shaking, cracks in bruised sky, ground breaking apart
   - Sphere of force with Vorthanis inside, still pounding walls
   - Vorthanis's empty sockets found Eden through barrier
   - Lips readable: *"This isn't over."*
   - Whisper: *"It is for today. MOVE."*

**Threshold Closure:**
- Eden crossed
- Reality **SNAPPED** back (solid walls, normal gravity, breathable air)
- Threshold collapsing behind him
- Purple-green light flickering
- Through shrinking opening: pocket realm **imploding**
- Sphere of force tumbling into nothingness with Vorthanis inside
- **BOOM** - threshold CLOSED
- Circle went dark: just burned marks on floorboards
- Dimensional Anchor Ward, smoke pellets, Chime: lost inside
- But Vorthanis: gone

**Silence. Three seconds. Nobody moved.**

---

### Immediate Aftermath (Room 9)

**Brecht's Arrival:**
- In corridor with four palace guards
- Had been positioned outside entire time
- Waiting for outcome
- *"Report."*

**Eden (shaking from adrenaline crash):**
*"Mission accomplished. Kethris extracted. Threshold closed. Vorthanis neutralized."*

**Scene Assessment:**
- Kethris on floor, barely conscious, Lyren crying over her
- Carr applying healing potion
- Burned-out ritual circle (inert, dead)
- Subject Two cowering in corner (survived)
- Subject One: dead/unconscious against wall

**Brecht's Response:**
- Nod. *"Well done, Special Investigator."*
- Professional mask: *"Secure the prisoner. Get the injured to Temple healers. Lock down this building."*
- To Eden: *"You. Debriefing. One hour. After you've had a healing potion and stopped shaking."*

**Kethris to Eden (barely audible across room):**
*"Thank you."*

**Eden's hands: actually shaking**
- Whisper: *"Adrenaline. Normal. You did well."*
- Fang: chittering agreement

---

### Temple of Helm - Threat Assessment

**Thirty Minutes Later:**
- Eden: healed (potion: 8 HP, back to 15/12 temporarily over max)
- Washed pocket realm grime off
- Stopped shaking (mostly)

**Meeting with High Priestess Celeste:**

**Question:** What became of Vorthanis?

**Celeste's Analysis:**
*"When a pocket realm collapses, anything inside is ejected back to its plane of origin. Violently. Traumatically."*

**Vorthanis's Fate:**
- Thrown back to Lower Planes (his origin point)
- Essence intact but form **disrupted**
- Scattered across multiple layers
- Standard planar entity: days/weeks to reform
- Exarch with divine backing: **hours**, possibly less

**Critical Points:**
- He's alive (or whatever exarchs call existence)
- He's banished (can't manifest here easily)
- No infrastructure left in city (threshold closed, binding destroyed, pocket realm gone)
- Operation in ruins, prize taken
- For an exarch of pride and power: *"arguably worse than death"*

**Whisper's Assessment:**
*"He'll rebuild. He always does. But not here. Not soon. You bought time."*

---

### Temple Healing Ward - Kethris

**Kethris's Condition:**
- Private room, heavy wards (Brecht's work)
- Two guards outside
- Clean robes, binding marks bandaged
- Lyren beside her, holding hand, refusing to leave
- Carr in corner, watching (professional to the end)

**Celeste's Diagnosis:**
*"Necrotic corruption. Deep. Three days of active torture. You're lucky to be alive."*

**Kethris (voice still wrecked, dark humor):**
*"Luck had nothing to do with it. The boy wizard—"* (looks at Eden) *"—you're taller than I expected from the reports."*

**The Reports:**
*"Your father's been sending me updates for eight months. Every tactical decision. Every improvisation. Every time you did something that made him proud and terrified in equal measure. He was right about you."*

**Aldrin's Message Delivered:**
*"The wards held."* (37 years of surveillance detection, records kept safe)

Kethris closed eyes: relief. *"Good. Then it wasn't for nothing."*

**Recovery Timeline:**
- Celeste: *"Weeks. Minimum. You're staying here under guard and divine healing until I'm satisfied you won't collapse."*
- Kethris: *"Acceptable."* (too exhausted to fight)

**To Eden:**
*"Thank you. For not leaving me there. For ignoring my orders to close the threshold. For being exactly as stubborn as your father."*

*"He'll want to see you. Soon. There's... a lot to discuss."*

**Whisper to Kethris:**
*"Welcome back, Kethris."*

**Kethris:**
*"Thank you, old friend."*

---

### Whisper's Introduction

**Eden:** "I apologize, but a combination of circumstances and suspicion prevented me from becoming properly acquainted. Do you have a name?"

**Whisper:**
*"I have several. But the one Kethris uses is 'Whisper.'"*

**Etymology:**
- Tells Kethris things quietly that she needs to hear
- Moves through spaces without being noticed
- Once scared Kethris appearing silently beside her head at 3 AM (43 years ago, still not funny / still funny)

**History with Lyren:**
*"Since she was twenty-two. Since her elevation to exarch. I was there when you were born. I watched you grow. I reported your sixteenth birthday to Kethris when she was on a mission three cities away and couldn't be there herself."*

**On Eden's Suspicion:**
*"Your suspicion was warranted, Special Investigator. I was an unknown variable. You treated me appropriately - with caution, verification, and conditional trust. That's good tactical instinct. It's also why Kethris chose you."*

**On Kethris's Choice:**
*"Your father presented you as an option. Kethris evaluated you independently. Watched you at Thornhaven. Observed your tactics, your ethics, your capacity for creative violence. She could have sent someone else. She has three other exarchs who oppose Vorthanis. She has Rookery contacts. She has resources. She sent you because you think like her. And because she knew you'd actually pull it off."*

**Final Assessment:**
*"You did well, Eden Sagebough. Better than well. You did what I thought impossible - you extracted an exarch from Vorthanis's prison and survived to tell about it. Your father will be insufferably proud. Prepare for that. Thank you. For bringing her back."*

---

### The Debriefing (Warded Meeting Room)

**Attendees:**
- Brecht (Crown authority, taking notes for King)
- Vane (Rookery operative)
- Miriam (Support operative)
- Devin (Anchor specialist)
- Aldrin Sagebough (Eden's father, waiting)

**Aldrin's Reaction:**
- Stood when Eden entered
- Expression: relief, pride, six other controlled emotions
- Didn't speak, just looked
- Waiting

**Eden's Report:**
- Straight tactical timeline
- No embellishments needed
- Entry to extraction: 60 seconds
- Zero casualties (extraction team)
- Vorthanis banished
- Threshold permanently closed
- Delivered like operational report (because that's what it was)

**Brecht's Assessment:**
*"Efficient. Professional. Absolutely insane."*

**Vane (Rookery):**
*"We'll be billing the Crown for hazard rates and equipment loss. Three operatives in a Lower Planes extraction - that's not standard contract work."*

**Brecht:**
*"Bill approved. Itemize it and send it through normal channels."*

**The King's Briefing (Fifth Bell):**
- Sanitized version
- Planar threat in Dock Ward
- Joint operation: Crown + consultants
- Threat neutralized
- No civilian casualties
- Minimal property damage

**Cultist Disposition:**
- Subject One: deceased
- Subject Two: custody, will cooperate for clemency
- Lyren Ashveil: Crown protection and immunity (prior arrangement)
- Eden: no objection

**Brecht's Orders:**
*"Special Investigator Sagebough. You're officially off-duty for forty-eight hours. That's an order, not a suggestion. Go sleep. See your father. Process what just happened. Don't do anything heroic."*

*"And for gods' sake, write down what you learned about pocket realm extraction before you forget the details. The Crown has exactly zero institutional knowledge on this and you just became our only expert."*

**Vane's Parting Words:**
*"The Rookery doesn't give compliments easily. But you earned one today. If you ever want work outside Crown service, we'd be interested. Very interested."* (Recruitment offer, standing)

**Miriam:**
*"Your father spent eight months telling me you'd be ready when the time came. He undersold it. Rest, Eden. You've earned it."*

---

### Father and Son (Alone in Warded Room)

**Eden's Question:**
*"Well, Dad? Was it all worth it?"*

**Aldrin's Response:**
Pulled Eden into a hug (not tentative, not careful - just relief).

*"Yes. And no. And I don't know."*

**The Honest Answer:**
*"Was it worth twenty years of obsession, manipulation, and building my son into a weapon capable of walking into hell and coming back out? Ask me in ten years when I know what it cost you."*

*"Was it worth saving four thousand lives, stopping Vorthanis, extracting Kethris, and preventing a god's resurrection as a force of indiscriminate slaughter? Yes. Unequivocally yes."*

*"I spent twenty years preparing you for something I hoped you'd never have to do. And then I sent you to do it anyway. That's going to haunt me for the rest of my life, Eden. Regardless of how well it worked."*

**Fang's Gesture:**
Climbed from table onto Aldrin's shoulder (unusual - Fang rarely leaves Eden).

Aldrin: surprised, then softened.
*"Your familiar has better judgment than I do. He knows you're all right. He's telling me to believe it too."*

**The Question:**
*"Are you? All right?"*

**Eden's Answer:**
*"This will be the second time I've extracted people from interplanar thresholds. I'm beginning to get acclimated."*

**Aldrin's Laugh:**
Sharp, surprised, slightly broken. The laugh of realizing what he actually built.

*"Acclimated. To extracting people from interplanar thresholds. You're twenty years old, Eden. Most wizards don't attempt their first planar work until they're thirty. You've done it twice. And you're treating it like you're getting acclimated to morning coffee."*

*"Kethris was right. You do think like her. That same practical acceptance of absurd circumstances. Most people would be traumatized. Or at minimum, shaken. You're already cataloguing it as operational experience."*

**The Quiet Victory:**
*"Four thousand people down there. Going about their evening. Completely unaware. That's what we do this for. The people who never know."*

*"But it means there's no parade this time. No Star of Valor. Just Brecht's sanitized report and a classified file that gets buried in these Archives. How do you feel about that?"*

**Eden's Philosophy:**
*"Victory is victory. As long as it's acknowledged through the proper channels and it gets my team and I the resources we need when we need it, the pomp and circumstance is just extra."*

*"I'll take a celebration from time to time. It's just that that means the situation got so bad that discretion could no longer be exercised, which feels more like a private failure than a public success."*

**Aldrin's Recognition:**
*"That's exactly what Kethris said. Word for word. Two years ago when I asked her why she never took credit for the operations I knew she'd run."*

*"You really do think like her. Which means you've answered my question. You want this work. Not because I built you for it - though I did - but because it fits how you already think. I prepared you for something you were probably going to end up doing anyway."*

**The Power Structure Question:**
*"You're twenty years old and you've just become the nexus point for at least four different power structures. All of whom want you working with them. That's either the best position possible or the most dangerous."*

**Eden:** *"Probably both."*

**Aldrin:** *"Definitely both. So what do you do with it?"*

---

### Eden's Vision (The Librarian)

**Eden's Answer:**
*"To maximize impact and minimize danger, I should start playing these power structures off each other - more like a facilitator than a frontline soldier. That fits the kind of work I'd want to do anyway - putting information in the hands of the people that need it. A librarian."*

**Aldrin's Reaction:**
Went absolutely still. Stared. Then:

*"A librarian. Not a warrior. Not a spy. A librarian."*

*"Information in the hands of people who need it. Facilitating coordination between groups that don't talk to each other. Creating networks instead of fighting battles. That's exactly what I've been doing for twenty years. It's also exactly what Kethris does. What the Rookery does. What good intelligence work is."*

**The Reframing:**
*"Most people hear 'Special Investigator' and think combat. Direct action. Heroics. You hear it and think 'information architecture.'"*

*"The Crown already has soldiers. It has the Royal Guard, the army, Tormund for magical threats. What it doesn't have is someone who can coordinate quietly between the Crown, the Rookery, reformist exarchs, and gods know what other factions are operating in the margins."*

*"You just described becoming the information broker for threats the Crown can't officially acknowledge. Which is perhaps the most dangerous job in the kingdom and also the most necessary."*

**On Eden's Mother:**
*"Your mother would have loved this. She always said the most powerful person in any organization is whoever controls the filing system."*

**The Role:**
*"The role you're describing doesn't have a name yet. It's not quite Crown service. Not quite independent operation. Something in between. Kethris calls people like that 'anchors.' Fixed points that multiple networks can attach to. Stable. Trusted. Neutral enough to work with anyone, committed enough to actually care about outcomes."*

**Critical Advice:**
*"If you're going to be that, you need to set boundaries now. Before the power structures start treating you as an asset they own instead of a person they work with. The Crown will want exclusivity. The Rookery will want leverage. Kethris will want loyalty to her faction. You can't give any of them everything without losing what makes you valuable to all of them."*

*"Your independence is your power. Protect it."*

**Aldrin's Pride:**
*"I'm proud of you, Eden. Not for what you did today - though that was extraordinary. I'm proud because you're thinking about how you want to do this work, not just that you can. That's the part I didn't teach you. That's all you."*

**Final Words:**
*"Get some rest. Come see me when you're ready to talk about what's in those surveillance records. The ones from the third shelf."* (Volume 6 of *Planar Taxonomies* - 37 years of data)

## Character Development

### Eden Sagebough

**Operational Identity Crystallized:**
- Not a warrior (Level 2 wizard in sixth-level combat)
- Not a hero (quiet victory, no recognition)
- A **facilitator** - putting information in the right hands
- A **librarian** - information architecture as weapon
- An **anchor** - stable point for multiple power structures

**Tactical Maturity:**
- Misdirection over direct combat (Minor Illusion, Disguise Self)
- Resource management (saved spell slots, used items strategically)
- Team coordination (clear signals, trust in specialists)
- Adaptability (nat 1 initiative → tactical victory through creativity)

**Psychological Development:**
- Confronted fear and chose certainty over bravery
- Accepted both manipulation and agency in his formation
- Defined his own role rather than accepting others' definitions
- Prioritized sustainable impact over recognition

**Key Quotes:**
- *"I'm not resisting. I'm just not interested."* (to Vorthanis's fear)
- *"A librarian."* (defining his role)
- *"I'm beginning to get acclimated."* (to planar extractions)
- *"I'm just finding where I'm needed."* (on his emerging role)

### Relationships Deepened

**Aldrin Sagebough:**
- From "architect of manipulation" to "proud father uncertain of cost"
- Honest confrontation about preparation vs. agency
- Mutual recognition: Eden is doing what Aldrin did, but chose it
- Surveillance records await (37 years of data to share)

**Kethris Mournshadow:**
- Formal introduction (though she's been watching 8 months)
- Mutual recognition of tactical thinking
- Debt acknowledged: Eden saved her against her orders
- Future coordination expected

**Whisper:**
- Name revealed, history shared
- 43 years with Kethris, present at Lyren's birth
- Assessment: Eden thinks like Kethris (highest compliment)
- Working relationship established

**The Rookery (via Vane):**
- Standing recruitment offer
- Professional respect earned
- Future partnership likely
- Independence preserved

**Crown (via Brecht):**
- Became sole institutional expert on planar extraction
- 48 hours off-duty (ordered, not requested)
- Trusted with impossible operations
- Documentation required (write it down before forgetting)

## NPCs Met/Developed

### Kethris Mournshadow (Finally Met)

**First Words:** *"You're taller than I expected from the reports."*

**History:** 43 years as Bhaal exarch, 417 kills, 6 mass casualty events prevented

**Philosophy:** Murder as scalpel, not hammer - guided death vs. indiscriminate slaughter

**Personality:** Dark humor under torture, stubborn (told rescuers to leave her), protective of daughter, pragmatic

**Relationship with Aldrin:** 11 years of coordination, mutual respect, shared mission

**Current Status:** 
- Critical condition, weeks of recovery needed
- Temple of Helm, heavily guarded
- Lyren at bedside constantly
- Will want to debrief Eden when able

**Quote:** *"Thank you. For not leaving me there. For ignoring my orders to close the threshold. For being exactly as stubborn as your father."*

### Lyren Ashveil

**Role:** Kethris's daughter (25), deep cover operative for 8 months

**Personality:** Fierce, protective, emotional (crying over mother), skilled (destroyed first binding mark)

**Combat:** Dual daggers, fast, trained by exarch mother

**Character Arc:** From scared deep-cover asset to daughter who fought to save her mother

**Current Status:** Crown protection and immunity, staying with Kethris during recovery

**Relationship with Whisper:** Emotional (familiar watched her grow up, was there when Kethris couldn't be)

**Future:** Likely to work with Eden/Kethris faction going forward

### Vorthanis the Rendered (Antagonist)

**Fate:** Banished to Lower Planes, form disrupted, will reform in hours/days

**Status:** Alive but no infrastructure to return (threshold closed, pocket realm destroyed, binding broken)

**Threat Level:** Still dangerous, will rebuild, but "not here, not soon"

**Personal Vendetta:** Knows Eden by name ("Aldrin Sagebough's little project"), will remember

**Quote:** *"This isn't over."* (through sphere of force, before collapse)

### Whisper (Kethris's Familiar)

**Full Introduction:** Name, history, personality revealed

**Age:** 43 years bonded to Kethris

**Personality:** Patient, testing, appreciative of competence, dark sense of humor

**Relationship with Kethris:** Deep partnership, trusted completely

**Assessment of Eden:** Thinks like Kethris, actually pulled off the impossible, father will be insufferably proud

**Current Status:** With Kethris during recovery, available for coordination

---

## Themes Explored

### Victory Without Recognition

**Thornhaven:** 300 lives, parade, knighthood, Star of Valor
**Room 9:** 4,000+ lives, classified report, buried in archives

Eden's realization: Public celebration means discretion failed. The best victories are quiet.

**Quote:** *"It feels more like a private failure than a public success."*

### Information as Power

Not combat prowess, not magical might, but **coordination between groups** that don't normally communicate. The librarian as most powerful role.

### Constructed vs. Authentic Self

Aldrin built Eden's capabilities deliberately. Does that invalidate Eden's choices? Eden's answer: "Arranged opportunity, not arranged conclusion." The preparation was manipulation; the choices are his own.

### Fear and Certainty

The nat 20 fear save wasn't about bravery. It was about being **certain** of purpose. Vorthanis's intimidation was real; Eden just didn't care because he knew why he was there.

**Aldrin's advice:** *"The people who survive the Lower Planes are the ones who walk in knowing exactly what they're not willing to compromise."*

### Independence as Power

Multiple factions want Eden. His value is in being **neutral enough to work with anyone, committed enough to care about outcomes**. The moment he becomes owned by one faction, he loses value to all of them.

### The Cost of Quiet Work

Kethris: 43 years, 417 kills, 6 massacres prevented, zero public recognition
Aldrin: 20 years, one case, massive impact, no acknowledgment
Eden: Following in those footsteps, accepting that this is the work

---

## Plot Threads

### Resolved
- **Kethris extraction**: Successful, she's alive and recovering
- **Vorthanis threat** (immediate): Banished, infrastructure destroyed, bought time
- **Threshold in Dock Ward**: Permanently closed
- **Mass casualty event**: Prevented (4,000+ lives saved)
- **Lyren's deep cover**: Extraction complete, Crown protection secured

### Advanced
- **Eden's role definition**: From unclear to "information broker/anchor point"
- **Father-son relationship**: From tension to mutual understanding
- **Kethris coordination**: From theoretical to actual (will resume when she recovers)
- **Rookery partnership**: From contact to standing recruitment offer
- **Eden as planar expert**: Crown's only institutional knowledge source

### Opened
- **Vorthanis's return**: Will rebuild, will remember, personal vendetta established
- **Aldrin's surveillance records**: 37 years of data awaiting analysis (third shelf)
- **The other reformist exarchs**: 2 more besides Kethris, potential coordination
- **The accelerationist faction**: 3 more exarchs besides Vorthanis (eliminated their leader)
- **Bhaal's resurrection**: Still theoretical threat, accelerationist timeline disrupted
- **Eden's boundaries**: How to maintain independence while working with multiple factions
- **Kethris's recovery**: Weeks of downtime, what happens to her network?
- **Lyren's integration**: What role does she take post-extraction?
- **Crown institutional knowledge**: Writing down planar extraction procedures
- **The quiet work**: Building the information architecture role

### Long-term
- **Multiple power structure coordination**: Crown + Rookery + Reformist Exarchs + ?
- **Vorthanis's revenge**: When he reforms, he'll come for Eden and Aldrin
- **Bhaal exarch schism**: 3 reformists vs 3 remaining accelerationists (Vorthanis banished)
- **Eden's independence**: Maintaining neutrality as value increases
- **The filing system**: Becoming the person who "controls the filing system" (mother's wisdom)

## Memorable Moments

1. **Nat 1 initiative** → immediate tactical disadvantage overcome by creativity
2. **"BREACH!"** → Eden's call to action, team synchronization
3. **The pocket realm opening** → reality tearing apart, geometry fundamentally wrong
4. **Verification question passed** → "This was your grandmother's. Now it's yours. Keep it sharp."
5. **"Who said anything about trying, jerk?"** → Voice projection as Kethris, psychological warfare
6. **Nat 20 fear save** → "I'm not resisting. I'm just not interested."
7. **Kethris screaming** → Lyren destroying first binding mark, the cost of rescue
8. **The Chime ringing** → Three marks shattering simultaneously, purple light bleeding out
9. **"PULL!"** → Eden's signal, Carr's response, extraction in motion
10. **Bead of Force deployment** → Dirty 20 DEX save, inches from self-trap
11. **Vorthanis contained** → Pounding uselessly against sphere, silently furious
12. **"This isn't over"** → Vorthanis through force wall, before realm collapse
13. **Pocket realm implosion** → Watching it tear itself apart from safety
14. **Threshold closure** → BOOM. Silence. Three seconds. Nobody moved.
15. **Kethris to Eden** → "Thank you" across the room, barely audible
16. **"A librarian"** → Eden defining his role, Aldrin's recognition
17. **Whisper's name** → "The one Kethris uses is 'Whisper'"
18. **Fang to Aldrin's shoulder** → Unusual gesture, telling father to believe Eden is okay
19. **"I'm beginning to get acclimated"** → Eden's acceptance of absurd becoming normal
20. **"That's all you"** → Aldrin's final words, acknowledging Eden's agency

## Magic & Combat Analysis

### Why Eden Succeeded Against Sixth-Level Opposition

**Not through power:**
- Level 2 vs Level 6+ equivalent
- 3 spell slots vs extensive spellcasting
- 12 HP vs legendary creature
- Basic equipment vs home plane advantage

**Through tactics:**
- **Information advantage**: Knew Vorthanis's capabilities (truesight range, fear aura, spells)
- **Terrain manipulation**: Smoke blocked truesight, created zones of control
- **Misdirection**: Minor Illusion, Disguise Self, throw left/break right
- **Resource denial**: Dimensional Anchor removed teleportation option
- **Team coordination**: Specialists in roles, clear signals, trust
- **Speed over power**: 60-second operation, surprise advantage
- **Tool usage**: 6th-level artifacts from Tormund compensated for level disparity

### Spell Efficiency
- **Mage Armor**: Pre-cast, lasted entire operation
- **Detect Magic**: Ritual, no slot cost, identified binding marks
- **Comprehend Languages**: Ritual, ready if needed (wasn't)
- **Shield of Faith**: Miriam's, boosted AC to 17
- **Bless**: Miriam's, +1d4 to saves (saved Eden from Bead trap)

**Slots preserved:** 2 of 3
- Sleep: Never needed (Kethris unconscious from shock anyway)
- Magic Missile: Never needed (Chime did the work)

### Item Usage Excellence
Every item used at perfect moment:
- **Disguise Self**: Psychological warfare, bought crucial seconds
- **Smoke pellets**: Blocked truesight, created tactical zones
- **Flash powder**: Misdirection, split Vorthanis's attention
- **Chime of Opening**: Instant three-mark destruction
- **Dimensional Anchor**: Removed Vorthanis's mobility
- **Bead of Force**: Perfect containment, 60-second extraction window

**Unused but ready:**
- Gaseous Form (emergency escape if trapped)
- Final healing potion (team mostly unscathed)

## Next Session Preview

**48 Hours Off-Duty:**

Eden has two days to:
- **Rest and process** (first time since Thornhaven to truly breathe)
- **Review Aldrin's surveillance records** (37 years of data on third shelf)
- **Write planar extraction procedures** (Brecht's order, Crown documentation)
- **Visit recovering Kethris** (debrief, coordination discussion)
- **Define boundaries** (before power structures make claims)
- **Explore the librarian role** (what does information architecture actually look like?)

**Pending Developments:**
- Kethris's recovery and network status
- Lyren's integration and future role
- Rookery partnership formalization (or rejection)
- Crown's institutional planar knowledge building
- Vorthanis's reformation timeline
- The other reformist exarchs (who are they?)
- Aldrin's surveillance reveals (who's been watching for 37 years?)

**Immediate Questions:**
- What's in volume 6 of *Planar Taxonomies*?
- How does Eden set boundaries with four power structures?
- What does "information in the right hands" actually mean operationally?
- When does Vorthanis reform and what does he do first?
- What role does Lyren want after her mother recovers?

**The Quiet After the Storm:**

For the first time since arriving in the capital nine days ago, Eden Sagebough has time to think. Not react. Not plan the next operation. Not survive the next crisis.

Just... think.

About what he's become.  
About what he wants to become.  
About the difference between those two things.

The city outside continues its evening. Four thousand people who will never know how close they came. That's the work now. The quiet victories. The classified files. The people who never know.

**Eden is off-duty for 48 hours.**

**What does a librarian do with two days to build an information architecture that doesn't exist yet?**

**Session 9 Complete: The Extraction**

*"I'm not resisting. I'm just not interested."*

*"A librarian."*

*"I'm beginning to get acclimated."*
