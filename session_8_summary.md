---

## Session Recap

Session 8 was a masterclass in operational preparation and alliance building. After discovering an invisible familiar spying in his quarters, Eden turned a security breach into a recruitment opportunity, leading to contact with the Rookery and the revelation of a much larger conspiracy involving Bhaal's exarch factions.

### Morning: The Invisible Familiar

Eden discovered an invisible rat familiar inspecting his spellbook. Rather than simply eliminating the threat, he captured it and sent a message through it: "Talk to the people wearing copper bracelets. They'll make it worth your while." This improvisation turned surveillance into negotiation.

The familiar's caster had released the bond - it was staying voluntarily. Over the next 18 hours, it would reveal itself to be Whisper, the familiar of Kethris Mournshadow, a reformist exarch of Bhaal.

### The Rookery Makes Contact

Vane arrived at breakfast, walking past Eden's protection detail with ease. She revealed herself as a Rookery operative (Quill-level decision maker) and delivered Blackwater's overnight report along with critical intelligence about Room 9 at the Harborview Boarding House.

**Key Intelligence:**
- Three Bhaal cultists in Room 9, but they'd lost operational control
- Active ritual circle creating a planar threshold to a pocket realm
- Something from the Lower Planes was preparing to manifest
- The entity: Vorthanis the Rendered, an accelerationist exarch
- Timeline: Day 8-9 before threshold stabilizes enough for physical manifestation
- Potential casualties: 4,000+ in Dock Ward, expanding concentrically

### The Warded Meeting Room

Following clues from Vane, Eden discovered his father's warded meeting room on the third floor of the Archives. The room contained seven layers of wards, placed over 37 years (starting 1289), each incorporating both abjuration and divination magic.

**Critical Discovery:** The wards don't just block scrying - they detect and record attempts. Aldrin Sagebough has 37 years of surveillance data on everyone who tried to eavesdrop on his private conversations.

The most recent ward layer was added eight months ago - right before everything with Thornhaven began moving.

### The Full Picture Emerges

In the warded room, Eden convened:
- **Brecht** (Royal Guard Commander) - Crown authority
- **Miriam Crowsinger** - Revealed to have long-standing Rookery arrangement
- **Vane** - Rookery operative coordinating the response
- **Whisper** (the familiar) - Intelligence asset and proof of Kethris's involvement

**The Situation:**
1. **Vorthanis the Rendered** - Accelerationist exarch who wants Bhaal resurrected through mass slaughter
2. **Kethris Mournshadow** - Reformist exarch who opposes indiscriminate killing, captured by Vorthanis 3 days ago
3. **Lyren Ashveil** - Kethris's daughter, deep cover operative in the cult cell for 8 months
4. **The Threshold** - Opening to Vorthanis's pocket realm where Kethris is bound as ritual anchor
5. **The Timeline** - Day 8-9 before Vorthanis completes his work

**The Exarch Schism:**
- 7 total exarchs of Bhaal (dead god, fragmented divine mandate)
- 4 accelerationists (want resurrection through mass death)
- 3 reformists (oppose indiscriminate slaughter)
- Vorthanis leads accelerationists, has been operating 11 years
- **Vorthanis told Elara Moonshadow which grimoires to steal in 1284**

### Aldrin's Twenty-Year Plan

Eden confronted his father in the secured wing. Aldrin confirmed what Eden had pieced together:

- He'd been coordinating with Kethris for 11 years (since she started feeding him intelligence on Vorthanis)
- The Thornhaven letter was deliberate - "arranged opportunity, not arranged conclusion"
- Miriam was placed in Thornhaven 8 months ago to wait for Eden
- The entire 20-year investigation was preparation for this moment
- Aldrin built Eden's capabilities deliberately, but tried to preserve Eden's agency in how they were used

**Aldrin's message for Kethris:** "The wards held." (The surveillance detection system worked, the records are safe)

### Operational Planning

Eden was assigned **frontline** - the most dangerous role, responsible for severing Vorthanis's binding on Kethris. The team:

**Roles:**
- **Eden** - Frontline (sever binding marks)
- **Miriam** - Support (keep Eden alive)
- **Carr** - Extraction specialist (get Kethris out)
- **Devin** - Anchor & reconnaissance (hold the door, maintain beacon)
- **Brecht** - Anchor team leader (this-side coordination)
- **Lyren** - Inside asset (secure Room 9, prevent cultist interference)

**The Plan:**
1. Breach immediately (Day 7, fourth bell) for surprise advantage
2. Deploy smoke to block Vorthanis's 60-foot truesight
3. Eden approaches disguised as Kethris (Disguise Self scroll)
4. Verify Kethris with question only she can answer
5. Sever 4 of 7 binding marks (breaks the anchor)
6. Extract before Vorthanis can respond
7. Close threshold with Kethris on this side

### Equipment and Preparation

**From Tormund:**
- Potion of Gaseous Form (emergency escape)
- Dimensional Anchor Ward (stops teleportation in 30-foot radius)
- **Chime of Opening** (disrupts 3 binding points instantly - 6th level artifact)
- Bead of Force (creates 10-foot sphere, nothing in/out for 1 minute)
- Authorization letter for emergency artifact loan

**From Temple of Helm:**
- 5 holy symbols (consecrated, anti-planar protection)
- Healing potions (temple-grade, 2d4+2, bonus vs necrotic)

**Tactical Supplies:**
- 2 smoke pellets (10-foot radius heavy obscurement each)
- 2 flash powder packets (blind effect, 10-foot radius)
- Disguise Self scroll (1 hour duration)
- Anti-scrying pin (already equipped)

**Rituals Prepared:**
- Mage Armor (AC 15→17 with Shield of Faith)
- Detect Magic (see binding points, magical traps)
- Comprehend Languages (understand Lower Planes entities)

### The Verification Question

Whisper provided Eden with a protocol: A question about what Kethris said when giving Lyren her 16th birthday gift. Only Kethris and Lyren know the answer. If the bound figure answers wrong, it's a trap - abort immediately.

The question and answer would be provided at the threshold (30 seconds before breach) to prevent Speak with Dead exploitation if Eden died.

### Intelligence on Vorthanis

**Capabilities:**
- 6th-level equivalent spellcasting (spells up to 3rd level)
- Truesight 60 feet (sees through invisibility, illusions, magical darkness)
- Fear aura 30 feet (passive, CON save DC 14)
- Counterspell, Mirror Image, Misty Step (30-foot teleport)
- Vampiric Touch, Hold Person, Bestow Curse
- Speak with Dead (can interrogate corpses for intelligence)
- Legendary actions in his own pocket realm

**Weaknesses:**
- Truesight doesn't extend to hearing (audible illusions work)
- Physical smoke blocks truesight (not magical obscurement)
- Limited Counterspell slots (can be baited)
- Arrogant (will waste time on misdirection)

**Pocket Realm Hazards:**
- Terrain shifts, gravity inconsistencies
- Air breathable but toxic over time
- Temperature extremes
- Time dilation ~1.2:1 (4 minutes inside = 5 outside)
- Designed to resist mortal presence
- 3-5 additional hostile entities expected

### Key Character Moments

**Eden's Certainty:** When asked what he's certain about before the mission, Eden distinguished between three types:
- Certain he's prepared? Yes.
- Certain it'll work? No.
- Certain what he's fighting for? Absolutely.

**Aldrin's Guilt:** "Did I build you into something you didn't want to be?" The question at the heart of their relationship - manipulation vs. preparation.

**Eden's Response:** "I've come around." Acknowledging both the manipulation and his own agency in what comes next.

## Themes Explored

### Manipulation vs. Agency
The session's deepest theme: Aldrin spent 20 years building Eden into someone capable of this work. Eden discovers this and must decide if that invalidates his choices or if he can claim agency anyway. His answer: "Arranged opportunity, not arranged conclusion."

### Working with "Evil"
Eden negotiating with a Bhaal exarch's familiar, coordinating with assassins, accepting help from a murder god's reformist faction. The moral complexity of outcomes-based ethics vs. deontological rules.

### Information Architecture
Eden's emerging understanding that his role isn't frontline combat but coordination - putting information in the right hands, facilitating cooperation between groups that don't trust each other.

### Trust and Verification
Multiple layers: Eden testing Whisper, Whisper testing Eden, verification questions, professional courtesy between operators. Trust earned incrementally through demonstrated competence.

### The Cost of Preparation
Aldrin's guilt about manipulating his son vs. the necessity of preparing for real threats. The question every parent faces: how much do you shape vs. how much do you allow emergence?

## Tactical Decisions

### Why Breach Immediately (Day 7 vs Day 8-9)
- Vorthanis expects resistance Day 8 or later (when threshold nears completion)
- Surprise is Eden's primary advantage against superior force
- Cultists are fractured (second bell argument), easier to manage now
- Kethris has been tortured 3 days - condition deteriorating
- Speed over perfect preparation

### Why Eden Takes Frontline
- Unknown to Vorthanis (not being watched)
- Vane is Rookery (Lyren might recognize signature)
- Miriam was under surveillance (Vorthanis may have seen her)
- Familiar can't fight but can guide to binding points
- Eden's specialty is misdirection, not direct combat

### Disguise Self as Kethris
- Psychological warfare - Vorthanis spent 3 days breaking her
- Seeing "Kethris" approaching creates hesitation
- Buys 10-15 seconds of confusion before truesight reveals truth
- First-person knowledge from Whisper makes disguise convincing

### Smoke Wall Strategy
- Physical obscurement blocks truesight (magical darkness doesn't)
- Forces Vorthanis to either advance blind or reposition
- Creates zones: deception range (outside 60 ft) and danger range (inside)
- Limits his tactical options while preserving team mobility

## Next Session Preview

**Session 9 will open at the Harborview Boarding House, fourth bell, Day 7:**

The team is positioned. The threshold is active and unstable. Room 9 contains three cultists - two true believers, one deep cover operative who doesn't know her mother needs rescue.

Beyond the threshold: Vorthanis the Rendered, a pocket realm designed to kill intruders, and Kethris Mournshadow bound as a ritual anchor.

Eden has 60 seconds from breach to extraction. 

The plan is insane.

It might work.

**The door to Room 9 opens...**
