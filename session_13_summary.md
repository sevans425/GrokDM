# Session 13 Summary
**Campaign**: The Thornhaven Shadow Crisis (Royal Court Arc)  
**Session Date**: 2026-02-22  
**In-Game Date**: Day 12 (dawn through evening)  
**Session Length**: Full downtime day - funerals, friendship, feelings, catastrophic romantic incompetence

---

## Session Recap

Session 13 was the emotional aftermath of Session 12's divine battle. Eden attended funeral rites for the fallen, tried (and failed spectacularly) to meditate, played competitive board games, had multiple emotional breakdowns, accidentally confessed romantic feelings, and learned that exarchs are easier to handle than having a crush.

The session was pure character development, relationship building, and watching a 20-year-old tactical genius completely fall apart when confronted with normal human emotions.

---

## Day 12 - Dawn: Funeral Rites

**Temple of Helm, Morning**

Eden woke sore and bruised from the previous day's combat. Got dressed in formal attire - appropriate for honoring the dead.

**Morning Portent: 10 and 15**

Not dramatic. Just... normal. Middle-of-the-road results. No natural 20s to save the day, no natural 1s to weaponize. Just regular dice for a day that wasn't supposed to be about combat.

### The Five Fallen

**Those Who Died in the Battle:**
1. **Brother Marcus** - Temple paladin (executed by Vex while defending unconscious)
2. **Private Corrin** - Crown guard (Malthor's death burst)
3. **Private Selene** - Crown guard (Malthor's death burst)
4. **Sergeant Daveth** - Crown guard (Malthor's death burst)
5. **Private Oren** - Crown guard (Malthor's death burst)

Five names. Five lives. Five families grieving.

### The Ceremony

High Priestess Celeste led the formal rites. Prayers to Helm. Traditional words about duty, sacrifice, the cycle of death and rebirth.

**The Families:**
- Brother Marcus's mother (older woman, tears streaming silently)
- Private Corrin's family (young man with small child who didn't understand)
- Siblings/partners for other guards (grief raw and visible)
- Parents holding it together through sheer will
- A widow staring at the shroud

Eden positioned himself at the edge of Crown officials. Closer to the families than the other representatives. Not hiding behind rank.

**The Speeches:**

**Brother Marcus's Mother:**
Spoke about her son choosing protection thirty years ago. Died defending wounded allies. Didn't run. Stood against divine threats.

She looked directly at Eden - the youngest official there, meeting her gaze openly while others looked down.

*"He died well. That's what matters. He died protecting people."*

**Private Corrin's Brother:**
Couldn't finish. Just shook his head. The child kept asking "Where's Papa?"

**Commander Brecht's Speech:**
Professional. Commander's voice. *"They knew the risk. They went anyway. That's what Crown guards do - we stand between our people and harm."*

Gave families context - their loved ones died preventing coordinated exarch assault. Hundreds, maybe thousands saved.

### Eden's Speech

Celeste asked if anyone else wished to speak.

Brother Marcus's mother was looking at Eden. So was Corrin's brother.

They knew. Somehow they knew he was involved.

**Eden stepped forward.**

*"Many of you will know my face from the recent knighting ceremony. My name is Special Investigator Eden Sagebough, and I am the one responsible for the tactical decisions that put your loved ones in harm's way."*

*"When I put a stop to the Thornhaven Crisis, I was the only one directly in peril of death. But now, with command, I am reckoning with the fact that these people died on my orders. That is no small weight."*

*"But this - the reason I am here - is to give your grief a face. If you need someone to blame, someone to beg for answers, someone just to look to for reassurance that these people were heroes - I am that someone. I accept that, here, now, for you."*

*"But this isn't about me. This is about Marcus. Corrin. Selene. Daveth. Oren. I say their names in hopes that they will never be forgotten - that these names will enjoy their heroic tale being told again and again, and that you, their loved ones, will cherish what was given more than long for what was taken."*

**The Response:**

Absolute silence.

Then Brother Marcus's mother stood. Walked to Eden.

*"You're just a boy. You're just a boy and they gave you command and now my son is dead."*

Pause.

*"But you came here. You said their names. You didn't hide."* She squeezed his arm. Hard. *"Thank you for giving my grief a face. And damn you for being so young that you'll carry this for decades."*

Private Corrin's brother approached next:

*"Corrin talked about you. After Thornhaven. Said you were brave. Clever. Said if anyone could stop the next crisis, it was you."*

Looking at the child: *"He believed in you. So I guess I have to too. Just make it worth it. Make sure he didn't die for nothing."*

No one else approached. But they were looking at Eden differently.

Something had shifted.

---

## The Conservatory Disaster

After the funeral, Eden needed to rest. The King had given him three days off. Day 12 was day one.

**Lyren's Suggestion:**
The palace conservatory. Warm. Quiet. Plants. Fountain. Nobody goes there except gardeners.

Lyren came with him - to make sure he actually rested instead of secretly studying.

### The Meditation Attempt

**Eden's Problem:**
Never learned how to stop. To exist without purpose. Dad never stops, so Eden never stops.

**Lyren's Insight:**
*"My mom's the same way. Constant work. Because if she stops, something terrible happens. So I learned to be the same way. Always training. Always ready."*

*"But that's exhausting. And it doesn't actually prevent bad things. My mom still got captured despite all my preparation."*

*"You can't prevent every crisis by being constantly ready. Sometimes bad things just happen. Running yourself into the ground means you're exhausted when the crisis actually comes."*

**The Challenge:**
Sit quietly for ten minutes without narrating thoughts aloud or using Message or running away.

**What Actually Happened:**

Eden tried. Failed spectacularly.

- Attempted to count fountain drops (lost count immediately)
- Tried breathing with the rhythm (lasted 45 seconds)
- Thought about time remaining (worst thing possible)
- Spiraled about whether Lyren was asleep
- Wondered if Fang was asleep (lucky rat)
- Checked mental clock every thirty seconds
- Suffered horribly for what felt like an hour (was actually 10 minutes)

**When Lyren Finally Said "Time's Up":**

Eden: *"AAAAGGGGGHHH. HATED IT. WHYYYYY?"*

Actual emotion. Not trying to be stoic. Just honest frustration.

**Lyren's Assessment:**
*"Meditation is not for you. Your brain is too... you."*

Suggested trying something else. Something that engages the brain but isn't work.

---

## Throne's Gambit (The Board Game Incident)

**The Game:**
Territory control strategy game. Dice rolls for combat. Resource management. Complex but fun.

**The Stakes:**
Winner gets to solve the puzzle box. Loser has to watch without helping.

**The Game:**

Both rolled nat 6 for initiative (tied).

Eden rerolled: **Nat 1**. Lyren went first.

The game was close. Both good at it for different reasons:
- Eden: pattern recognition, strategic thinking
- Lyren: adaptation, risk-taking

**Key Moments:**

Contested resource-rich territory. Lyren rolled 5 to attack. Eden needed 6+ to win.

Rolled: **Natural 6**. 

Eden's internal monologue (which he ALMOST said out loud): *"GET ABSOLUTELY DUNKED ON, YOU SMUG LITTLE—"*

Caught himself. Barely.

**The Final Battle:**

Both at 4 territories. Next territory wins.

Round 1: Lyren rolled 4. Eden rolled 2. Territory stays neutral.

Round 2: Lyren rolled 3. Eden rolled 3. Still neutral.

Round 3: Lyren rolled **5**. Won the game.

Victory dance. Actual victory dance.

*"The great Special Investigator Eden Sagebough, who ended a divine civil war, just got CRUSHED at Throne's Gambit!"*

### The Puzzle Box Torture

Lyren grabbed the puzzle box. Complex mechanism - sliding panels, rotating sections, sequential locks.

*"Now watch and learn while I solve this impossible puzzle. And remember - no helping. Those were the stakes."*

**Eden's Guilt Trip Attempt:**

*"You and I BOTH know that game came down to chance! And I have DIVINATION magic! I have PORTENTS! Do you really think you won fair and square?"*

**Lyren's Response:**

*"You didn't USE Portent! That was your CHOICE! You thought you could win without it. That's called HUBRIS."*

*"Also - using divine magic to win at board games? That's just sad."*

Eden had no counter-argument. She was right.

**The Dramatic Exit:**

Eden rage-quit. Stormed off. Made it twenty feet down the corridor.

Then stopped.

Couldn't help himself. Had to know how the puzzle worked.

Turned around. Walked back.

**Lyren's Reaction:**

*"I KNEW IT. I knew you couldn't resist! You made it what, thirty seconds? Twenty feet?"*

Gestured to his abandoned chair. *"Sit. Watch. Learn. And remember - no helping. You LOST."*

### The Suffering

Eden sat there watching Lyren solve the puzzle.

She was doing it WRONG. Not optimal. Functional but inefficient.

**Eden's Physical Response:**
- Jaw clenched
- Fingers twitching
- Arms crossed, uncrossed, crossed again
- Eye started twitching
- Literally biting tongue to prevent helping

**Lyren's Deliberate Torture:**

She noticed the eye twitch. Started doing things OBVIOUSLY wrong just to watch him suffer.

Tried sequences she could SEE were incorrect. Backtracked. Tried again.

*"Hmm. Interesting."* (She had no idea why it worked)

**The Breaking Point:**

Both eyes twitching. Fingers drumming. Fang worried he might have an aneurysm.

Lyren rotated a panel BACKWARDS when it should go FORWARDS and the internal mechanism was jamming—

**CON Save DC 12 to maintain silence:**

Rolled: **2**

**CATASTROPHIC FAILURE**

### The Explosion

Eden EXPLODED out of his chair.

*"YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG!"*

*"The top panel rotates CLOCKWISE first, THEN you slide the middle section left TWO clicks, not one, which releases the internal lock mechanism and THEN you can access the bottom sequence but you have to do it in REVERSE ORDER because the designer was SADISTIC and—"*

Stopped. Breathing hard.

**Lyren's Delight:**

*"You BROKE. You made it maybe five minutes before BREAKING COMPLETELY."*

Full laughter. Genuine delight at watching him suffer and fail.

**The Mercy:**

She offered a deal: *"We'll call it a draw. You help me solve it, I don't torture you anymore."*

Eden took the puzzle box with shaking hands.

Solved it in about thirty seconds. Each sequence flowing naturally.

Inside: A carved raven figurine.

**Lyren:** *"All that for a bird statue."*

**Eden:** *"The journey, not the destination."*

Lyren gave him the figurine. *"You earned the weird bird through sheer psychological torture."*

---

## The Scrying Sensor Discovery

**Evening - Eden's Quarters**

Eden had a hunch. Cast Detect Magic on the raven figurine.

**Result:** Moderate Divination magic.

Not just a carved bird. It was enchanted. A **sensor** - the kind that lets someone see through it remotely. Scrying device.

Possibly triggered by opening the puzzle box. Someone might be watching. Or might HAVE been watching.

### The Friend Instinct

**Eden's Brain Said:** Tell Brecht. Chain of command. Protocol. Security concern.

**Eden's Feet Walked:** Toward where Lyren went.

**Internal Crisis:**

*Why do I want to tell her first?*

*This is ridiculous. Should tell Thorne. Who's RIGHT THERE.*

*But I'm already halfway to the Temple wing.*

*Because she gave me the bird? Because we opened it together?*

**Fang:** *Because she's your friend and friends tell each other when weird magic birds are involved?*

Oh. Is that it?

Eden had never HAD a friend before. Didn't know the protocol.

**The Compromise:**

Cast Message to Thorne (to cover protocol):

*"Found divination magic on the raven. Scrying sensor, possibly active. Going to inform Lyren since she gave it to me, then will report to Brecht."*

Then continued to find Lyren.

### Kethris's Recovery Room

Found Lyren with her mother. Both mid-conversation.

**Eden:** *"This thing is a scrying sensor."*

**Kethris's Analysis:**

Confirmed. Moderate divination. Passive observation scrying sensor. Activates when the puzzle box opens.

So if someone was monitoring, they saw whoever solved it.

**What They Saw:**
- Two people playing board games
- Trash talk
- Eden's puzzle box breakdown (eye twitching, explosion, detailed lecture about clockwise rotation)
- Lyren torturing him
- The whole afternoon

**Possible Explanations:**

1. **Benign:** Someone likes watching people solve puzzles (embarrassing but harmless)
2. **Surveillance:** Someone monitoring palace recreational spaces (security breach)

Either way: Brecht needed to know.

### The Admission

**Kethris:** *"This needs to go to Brecht immediately."*

**Eden:** *"Brecht does need to know. Yesterday, he would've been the first."*

Caught himself. Too late.

**Lyren:** *"But today I was first?"*

**Kethris:** *"You came to tell Lyren before reporting to command. That's significant."*

**Lyren:** *"You could have just told Thorne. He was RIGHT THERE. But you walked past him to find me."*

**Kethris (gently):** *"Eden. You've been building professional networks for two weeks. But this is the first time you've made a friend. Isn't it?"*

The word hung there: **Friend.**

**Lyren:** *"Is that what this is? You wanted to tell your friend about the weird magic bird before filing the official report?"*

**Kethris:** *"It's okay to have friends, Eden. Even when you're Special Investigator. Especially then."*

### The Flight Response

Eden turned and walked out without a word.

Left. Down corridors. Past concerned priests. Back to quarters.

**Why?**

Because Lyren and Kethris pointing out what it meant made it REAL. Made it vulnerable. Made it WEIRD.

And Eden doesn't know how to handle that.

**At Quarters:**

Thorne: *"Sir? Commander Brecht has been notified. He's requesting the raven within the hour."*

Pause.

*"Also... Miss Lyren is here. She followed you."*

---

## The Fetal Position Incident

**Eden's Response (through the door):**

*"NO! No. This is weird and I hate it and I wish it would go away but I can't make it and this is embarrassing..."*

Trailed off into whimpers. Gradually adopted the fetal position.

**Lyren (through door):**

*"I can HEAR you, you know. The door isn't soundproof."*

*"I'm coming in. He's in the fetal position whimpering about feelings."*

### The Conversation

Lyren sat on the floor beside him. Not touching. Just present.

*"So. You had a feeling. A friend feeling. And it made you run away and adopt the fetal position."*

**Lyren's Honesty:**

*"You know what the really funny part is? I did the same thing yesterday. Got overwhelmed, needed air, ran away from the healing ward."*

*"Having friends is weird. Especially when you've never had them before. You don't know the rules. So you panic when you do something that feels vulnerable."*

*"Like prioritizing me over protocol. That felt vulnerable, right? Because it meant I mattered more than the operational chain of command in that moment."*

**The Ultimatum:**

*"I'll bring the raven to Brecht. Tell him everything."*

Pause.

*"But just so you know - next time you want to tell me something before going through official channels? Just do it. You don't have to overthink it. That's what friends do."*

*"I'll be back after I talk to Brecht. We're having dinner together. You, me, and your bruised dignity. Non-negotiable."*

She left.

**Fang:** *She's bossy.*

"I noticed."

*You like that she's bossy.*

"...maybe."

---

## The Familiar Bond Crisis

**While Lyren Was Gone:**

Eden lying on bed. Processing. Fang being MERCILESS.

**The Thought (INTERNAL):**

*AAAAGH, she is SO HOT. Shut up, Fang. Stupid familiar bond. Such a security vulnerability.*

**Fang:** *I didn't say anything.*

*That's the familiar bond. Not my fault you're broadcasting.*

**The Realization:**

Eden has a CRUSH. On Lyren. And Fang can feel it through the familiar bond.

**Fang's Commentary:**

*So when she gave you the puzzle box, and you exploded—*

"Stop."

*And when she sat next to you in the conservatory—*

"STOP."

*And when she threw herself in front of a death burst for you—*

"That was tactical!"

*Very tactical. Very strategic. That's definitely why you keep thinking about it.*

Pillow. Face. Muffle-scream.

**The Knock:**

Lyren: *"It's me. Can I come in or are you still in the fetal position?"*

Fang: *Show time.*

---

## The Dinner Confession

Lyren entered with dinner for two. Completely comfortable while Eden was internally SCREAMING.

**Lyren:** *"Brecht says the raven is being analyzed. Won't know for a few days if it's benign or surveillance."*

*"Also, Thorne told the kitchen staff we're having dinner together and Marta sent EXTRA dessert with 'a knowing look.' I think we're palace gossip now."*

**Eden's Threat:**

*"I am ordering Brecht to have him demoted and stationed in the mountains."*

### The Unraveling

Eden tried to eat. Hands shaking. Managed three bites before giving up.

**Lyren:** *"Seriously. What is going on? You fought three exarchs yesterday but THIS is making you fall apart?"*

**Eden's Internal Panic:**

*Does she know? She can't know. Please don't know. Oh gods she knows.*

**Lyren (realization dawning):**

*"Oh."*

Pause.

*"OH."*

Face going red. Standing up, sitting down, standing again.

*"You— I— wait, WHAT?"*

### The Actual Confession

**Eden (defeated, sheepish):**

*"I- I just think you're nice, OK? And pretty and smart and- ugh! I promise I was trying not to make it weird. Just- just leave if it makes you upset."*

**Lyren's Response:**

BLUSHING. Actually red.

*"I— you— wait, WHAT?"*

*"You think I'm— and you were— this WHOLE TIME you were—"*

Pacing. Flustered-pacing.

*"The puzzle box. The game. The conservatory. You were— oh gods."*

*"I was torturing you with that puzzle box and you were— and I was sitting next to you in the conservatory and you were— oh my GODS."*

Stopped. Looked at him.

*"You are the WORST at this. The absolute WORST. Two weeks ending divine civil wars and THIS is what breaks you?"*

### Eden's Defense

**Eden (sheepishly, defeated):**

*"My dad didn't prepare me for this."*

**Lyren's Reaction:**

LAUGHED. Actually laughed.

*"Your dad spent TWENTY YEARS preparing you for everything. Crisis management. Tactical planning. Exarch politics. But he didn't prepare you for 'how to tell someone you think they're pretty'?"*

Sat back down. Closer this time.

*"Okay. Let me help you out here."*

### The Reciprocation

**Lyren (still blushing):**

*"I think you're also nice. And smart. And not bad looking. Even when you're having puzzle box breakdowns."*

Pause.

*"There. See? Not that hard. You just SAY it instead of spiraling for hours."*

**Fang:** *THANK YOU. It was AWFUL.*

**Lyren:** *"How long was he—"*

*Since the fetal position. Maybe before.*

**Lyren:** *"Oh my gods. You poor disaster."*

### The Agreement

**Lyren:** *"So. Now we've both embarrassed ourselves completely. We're even. Can we PLEASE just eat dinner now? Like two people who... who like each other? Without any more spiraling?"*

**Eden (backtracking immediately):**

*"Oh, that would be nice. Wonderful, even. Just two friends...having dinner."*

**Lyren's Response:**

*"Friends. Right. Is that what we're calling it? Because thirty seconds ago you were talking about me being 'pretty and smart' and now we're back to 'friends'?"*

*"You can't just confess and then immediately backtrack, Eden. Pick one."*

**The Understanding:**

*"Look, I'm not going to make you define what this is right now. That would be cruel."*

*"But for the record - I didn't come back just because we're 'friends.' I came back because you're the first person who's made me laugh in weeks. Who treated the fake coup like a tactical problem. Who tried SO HARD to meditate that you failed a CON save."*

*"So yeah. Friends. Or... whatever this is. I'm okay with figuring it out as we go."*

They ate Marta's chocolate cake. The awkwardness eased.

**Lyren (leaving):**

*"For what it's worth? I'm glad you came to me first about the raven. Even if it made you spiral."*

*"Good night, Eden."*

---

## The Aldrin Conversation

**Immediately After Lyren Left:**

**Fang:** *You know your father is going to find out, right?*

*Because Thorne told kitchen staff. Kitchen staff told Marta. Marta will tell your father.*

**The Knock:**

Aldrin's voice: *"Eden? Are you still awake?"*

Fang: *About that long.*

### How Aldrin Found Out

**The Intelligence Network:**

1. **Marta** sent message: *"Check on your son who's having dinner with a young woman and looking very flustered."* (She used the word "flustered")

2. **Thorne** gave official report about scrying sensor, also mentioned Eden went to Lyren first (notable)

3. **Temple priest** mentioned Lyren followed Eden out of recovery room looking "concerned about his emotional state"

**Aldrin (piecing it together):**

*"The scrying sensor. The dinner. The emotional state. Marta's 'flustered' comment. Want to tell me what's actually going on?"*

### The Second Confession

**Eden (slumping forward, face in hands):**

*"DAAAAAD. I like her, OK? And I told her. Eventually. After almost having a mental breakdown. And she reciprocated. And we're SOMETHING. OK?! I don't know what's going on and it feels really good and really bad and—"*

**Aldrin's Response:**

*"Oh. Oh, Eden."*

Quiet. Understanding. Sad?

*"I'm sorry."*

### The Apology

**What Aldrin Said:**

*"I spent twenty years preparing you for crisis management. Information architecture. Tactical thinking. Maps and contracts and exarchs."*

*"But I never taught you how to talk to someone you care about. How to handle feelings that aren't tactical. How to be a person who has relationships instead of just operational contacts."*

*"Your mother would have known how to prepare you for this. She would have taught you that having feelings isn't a crisis to solve, it's just part of being human."*

*"But I didn't. Because I was too focused on making sure you could survive exarchs and forgot to teach you how to survive being twenty and having feelings."*

**The Offer:**

*"So. Tell me. How can I help? What do you need?"*

### Eden's Request

**First Request:**

*"Can you handle Kethris for me? Like, watch her? Understand however she's trying to maneuver this?"*

**Aldrin (laughing):**

*"You want me to run intelligence on Kethris Mournshadow to make sure she's not maneuvering her daughter into political arrangement?"*

*"That's actually not a bad instinct. Very tactical. You're treating this like an operation."*

**The Clarification:**

**Eden:** *"I didn't mean as a politician. I meant as a parent."*

**Aldrin (understanding):**

*"Oh. You're worried about what Kethris thinks. As Lyren's mother. Whether she approves."*

*"That's very sweet. And very normal."*

**Aldrin's Assessment:**

*"Kethris knows you. You saved her life. Coordinated the operation. Stood with families at the funeral."*

*"And she saw you and Lyren together today. When you came to tell Lyren first. Before command."*

*"Kethris isn't going to interfere unless Lyren is unhappy or being hurt. She trusts her daughter."*

*"But if you want my read? She was pleased. Maybe surprised, but pleased. She gave you permission to have this."*

### The Aldrin-Eden Parallel

**Aldrin's Story:**

*"Lyren sounds exactly like your mother. Relentless in the best way."*

*"She cornered me in the Archives. Said 'Aldrin, you're brilliant but you'll die alone surrounded by books if someone doesn't intervene.' Then she just kept showing up. Made me have lunch. Take walks. Talk about non-research things."*

*"I thought she was interfering with my work. Turns out she was saving my life."*

**The Pattern:**

*"If Lyren is doing the same - being assertive, pulling you out of your head - that's good. You need that."*

*"We Sagebough men need women who won't let us disappear into our work."*

**The Advice:**

*"Let her keep doing that. Don't try to control it or turn it tactical. Just let yourself enjoy being with someone who makes you better."*

### The Closing

**Aldrin (hand on shoulder):**

*"Get some sleep. Tomorrow you'll probably see Lyren again. Try not to have another breakdown."*

At door:

*"Your mother would be so happy right now. Not just about Lyren. About all of it. You having friends. Having feelings. Being a person."*

*"She'd also be laughing about the fetal position. Just so you know."*

He left.

**Fang:** *That was good. You did good.*

"I had a complete meltdown and confessed while spiraling."

*Yeah, but you DID it. And she likes you back. And your dad supports you. And Kethris isn't going to interfere.*

*Now sleep. Before you overthink this into another crisis.*

## Character Development

### Eden's Evolution

**Emotional Competence: Level 0**

Eden discovered that he has ZERO preparation for:
- Having friends
- Having feelings
- Expressing feelings
- Processing reciprocated feelings
- Being a person instead of an investigator

**Key Realizations:**

1. **He has a friend.** First real friend. Ever. Doesn't know the protocols. Panics when doing friend things.

2. **He has a crush.** On Lyren. Who is assertive and direct and makes him do things like relax and have feelings.

3. **His dad shaped him.** Twenty years of tactical preparation, zero years of emotional preparation. Aldrin acknowledges this and apologizes.

4. **He's like his father.** Both Sagebough men need assertive women who won't let them disappear into work. History repeating.

5. **Friends come before protocol sometimes.** And that's okay. Vulnerability is scary but worth it.

**Coping Mechanisms Discovered:**

- Fetal position (new!)
- Running away (physical retreat)
- Immediate backtracking after confession
- Treating relationships like operations (asking dad to "handle" Kethris)
- Message cantrip to avoid face-to-face communication

**Progress Made:**

- Actually confessed (even if it was a disaster)
- Didn't run away permanently (came back after 20 feet)
- Accepted reciprocation (then immediately backtracked, but still)
- Asked for help (told his dad)
- Showed up for funerals (gave families a face)

### Lyren's Character

**Assertive Leadership:**

She MADE Eden rest. Made him play games. Made him have dinner. Non-negotiable. She pursues what she wants.

**Similar Background:**

- Shaped by parent's work (Kethris the exarch)
- Learned to fight/protect because of constant danger
- Few friends growing up (others didn't understand)
- Also a lonely overachiever

**Emotional Intelligence:**

- Recognized Eden's spiral immediately
- Gave him space but also pursued
- Called out his backtracking ("Pick one")
- Set boundaries ("We'll figure it out as we go")
- Used humor to defuse tension

**The Reciprocation:**

Not just "I like you too." She explained WHY:
- He makes her laugh
- He treated the coup tactically (not horrified)
- He tried so hard at meditation he failed a CON save
- He's the first person in weeks who's made things feel lighter

### The Father-Son Dynamic

**Aldrin's Apology:**

Genuinely regretful. He prepared Eden for exarchs but not for being human. Recognizes the failure.

**The Pattern Recognition:**

Aldrin sees Lyren being assertive with Eden and immediately recognizes his late wife's approach. History repeating in the best way.

**The Support:**

- Offered to watch Kethris (as a parent, not politician)
- Gave advice based on his own experience
- Validated Eden's feelings
- Acknowledged Eden's mother would be proud

**The Parallel:**

Both Sagebough men:
- Brilliant but isolated
- Disappear into work
- Need someone assertive to pull them out
- Terrible at expressing feelings
- Excellent at tactical thinking, terrible at emotional navigation

---

## Relationships

### Eden & Lyren

**Status:** "Friends or whatever this is"

**What Happened:**
- Started as operational acquaintances (fake coup)
- Became friends (conservatory, games, dinner)
- Became... more? (mutual confession, reciprocation, agreement to figure it out)

**Key Moments:**
- Lyren saved Eden's life twice (potion, death burst)
- Eden came to her first with the raven (before command)
- Eden confessed (disaster, but honest)
- Lyren reciprocated (also blushing, also flustered)
- Agreement to figure it out together

**Dynamic:**
- She's assertive, he's overthinking
- She pursues, he retreats (then comes back)
- She's comfortable with feelings, he's catastrophically incompetent
- Both shaped by parents, both lonely overachievers
- Both enjoy competitive games and torturing each other

### Eden & Aldrin

**The Apology:**

Aldrin acknowledging he prepared Eden for everything except being a person. Genuine regret. Offering help now.

**The Support:**

Not judgment. Not mockery. Just understanding and assistance. Willing to "handle Kethris" (watch her as a parent, make sure she approves).

**The Validation:**

"Your mother would be happy." The highest praise Aldrin can give. Eden having friends and feelings means he's not just an investigator - he's a person.

### Eden & Kethris

**Kethris's Role:**

Observer. Supporter. Gave permission when she said "it's okay to have friends."

Saw Eden and Lyren together. Recognized what was happening. Was pleased.

**As Parent:**

According to Aldrin: Won't interfere unless Lyren is unhappy or hurt. Trusts daughter's choices. Already on Eden's side.

### Eden & Fang

**The Familiar Bond:**

Security vulnerability (Fang can feel EVERYTHING). Also emotional support system.

**Fang's Role:**

- Merciless commentary
- Emotional support rat
- Called out Eden's spiraling
- Witnessed the complete disaster
- Enormously satisfied with how it turned out

---

## Themes Explored

### Emotional Competence vs Tactical Competence

Eden can end divine civil wars. Plan fake coups. Analyze contracts. Handle exarchs.

But he CANNOT:
- Sit quietly for 10 minutes
- Tell someone he likes them without spiraling
- Accept reciprocation without immediately backtracking
- Exist without treating everything as an operation

**The Contrast:**

Yesterday: Fought three exarchs, used Portent perfectly, triggered insurrection, won.

Today: Lost at board game, failed meditation, adopted fetal position over feelings.

### Preparation vs Experience

**The Limitation of Preparation:**

Aldrin spent 20 years preparing Eden for crisis. But you can't prepare someone for having feelings. That comes from experience.

**Lyren's Insight:**

*"You can't prevent every crisis by being constantly ready. Sometimes you just have to experience things."*

### Shaped by Parents

**Both Eden and Lyren:**

Products of their parents' work. Aldrin built Eden for investigations. Kethris shaped Lyren for protection.

But both are MORE than what they were built for. They're people. With feelings. With needs.

**The Pattern Repeating:**

Aldrin + Eden's mother (assertive woman, withdrawn man)
Eden + Lyren (assertive woman, withdrawn man)

History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes.

### Vulnerability as Strength

**Eden's Growth:**

- Stood with families (vulnerable position)
- Told Lyren first (prioritized friend over protocol)
- Confessed feelings (terrifying but honest)
- Asked dad for help (admitted he didn't know what to do)

All vulnerable. All scary. All necessary.

### Friends vs Operational Contacts

**The Distinction:**

Eden has built networks. Crown officials. Temple hierarchy. Reformist exarchs. All operational.

Lyren is the first FRIEND. Someone he tells things to first. Someone who matters more than protocol in specific moments.

Learning the difference between:
- People who value you (operational respect)
- People who care about you (emotional connection)

### The Weight of Command

**Morning:** Stood with families of five people who died on his orders. Gave their grief a face. Said their names.

**Evening:** Had dinner with someone who makes him laugh. Played games. Had feelings.

Both necessary. Can't just be commander. Can't just be person. Have to be both.

*"I am the one responsible for the tactical decisions that put your loved ones in harm's way. But this is to give your grief a face."* - Eden

*"You're just a boy and they gave you command and now my son is dead. But you came here. You said their names. You didn't hide. Thank you for giving my grief a face. And damn you for being so young that you'll carry this for decades."* - Brother Marcus's mother

**On Meditation:**

*"AAAAGGGGGHHH. HATED IT. WHYYYYY?"* - Eden (after 10 minutes of meditation)

*"You can't just confess and then immediately backtrack, Eden. Pick one."* - Lyren

## Magic & Mechanics

### Portent (Day 12)

**Roll:** 10 and 15

Middle of the road. Not dramatic. Just normal dice for a day that wasn't about combat.

**Usage:** None. Didn't need them. Day was about relationships, not tactics.

### Spell Slots

**Used:**
- Detect Magic (ritual, no slot) - on the raven figurine
- Message (1st-level) - to Thorne

**Remaining:** Full spell slots (didn't need combat magic)

### The Scrying Sensor

**The Raven Figurine:**

Moderate Divination magic. Passive observation sensor. Activates when puzzle box opens.

**What It Saw (if monitored):**
- Eden and Lyren playing Throne's Gambit
- Eden losing, trying to guilt-trip with Portent mention
- Dramatic exit (20 feet)
- Immediate return
- Puzzle box torture
- Eye twitching
- CON save failure
- Explosion with detailed instructions
- The entire afternoon of competitive games and emotional incompetence

**Status:** Under analysis by Brecht. Won't know for days if benign or surveillance.

### Skills Not Used

**Meditation:** Attempted. Failed. Suffered for 10 minutes. Not doing that again.

**Tactical Planning:** Tried to apply to relationships. Didn't work. Aldrin advised against it.

**Divination for Romance:** Considered using Portent on board games. Lyren would lose respect. Didn't do it.

---

## The Palace Gossip Network

**Information Flow:**

1. Thorne → Kitchen staff (Eden having dinner with Lyren)
2. Marta → Aldrin (Eden "flustered" with "young woman")
3. Temple priest → Aldrin (Lyren "concerned" about Eden's "emotional state")
4. Result: Everyone knows

**Marta's Response:**

Sent EXTRA chocolate cake with "knowing look."

**Eden's Threat:**

Will have Thorne demoted and stationed in mountains.

**Reality:**

Will do no such thing. Thorne is his favorite. But the threat stands as principle.

---

## Unresolved Threads

**The Scrying Sensor:**

Under analysis. Won't know for days if:
- Benign puzzle enthusiast
- Palace surveillance
- Something else entirely

**The Relationship Status:**

Defined as: "Friends or whatever this is, we'll figure it out as we go"

Not official. Not undefined. Just... existing. Processing.

**Kethris's Approval:**

According to Aldrin: She's pleased. She's on Eden's side. But Eden still anxious about it.

**The Unknown Watcher:**

Still out there. 17 possible candidates. Will receive ward message eventually.

**Vorthanis's Body:**

Still needs proper disposal. Session 12 established all three accelerationists dead, but body status unclear.

**Eden's Report:**

King wants full written report. Eden has two more days off to write it.

**Return to Duty:**

Day 15 (three more days). Then back to active operations.

## Next Session Preview

**Day 13 - Second Day Off**

Tomorrow brings:
- Probably seeing Lyren again (Eden promised games with Portent)
- Navigating "whatever this is" 
- Possibly writing the operational report
- More emotional incompetence
- Fang's continued commentary
- Palace gossip intensifying

**The Questions:**
- Can Eden have a normal interaction with Lyren now?
- Will he use Portent on board games as threatened?
- How does Kethris actually feel about this?
- What IS the scrying sensor about?
- Can Eden go 24 hours without an emotional breakdown?

**The Big One:**

How does a 20-year-old tactical genius navigate his first relationship when he's literally never done this before and his only advisor is his dad (who also has no idea what he's doing)?

---

**Session 13 Complete: Feelings Are Harder Than Exarchs**

*"My dad didn't prepare me for this."*

*"You are the WORST at this. The absolute WORST."*

*"We Sagebough men need women who won't let us disappear into our work."*
