    43	
    44	**Player Experience**:
    45	Player quote: "Wow, even *I* feel exhausted after all that. I hate politics."
    46	
    47	Despite claiming to hate politics, player demonstrated exceptional political instincts throughout session. Strategic thinking applied to social situations with same tactical brilliance used against shadow creatures. Player exhaustion at end was visceral and thematically appropriate.
    48	
    49	**DM Assessment**:
    50	Session 5 represented major tonal shift from dungeon-crawling/investigation to court politics and diplomatic maneuvering. Player adapted brilliantly, showing versatility beyond combat optimization. The Tormund rehabilitation strategy was entirely player-initiated and executed with remarkable sophistication. Session successfully established:
    51	- Long-term campaign structure (transcription project)
    52	- Political power base for Eden at capital
    53	- Multiple relationship threads to develop
    54	- Ongoing threats (cultists) to balance scholarly work
    55	- Resources and support for future investigations
    56	
    57	**Next Session Preview**:
    58	Eden wakes Day 5 as Special Investigator with protection detail, powerful allies, assassination threat, and months of dangerous scholarly work ahead. Balance between court politics, magical education, transcription project, and cultist threat investigation.
