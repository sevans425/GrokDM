# Session 10 Quick Start Guide
**Campaign**: The Thornhaven Shadow Crisis (Royal Court Arc)  
**Current Date**: Day 7 evening / Day 8 morning  
**Eden's Status**: Off-duty for 48 hours (Brecht's order)  
**Location**: Royal Palace, Capital City

---

## What Just Happened (Sessions 8-9 Recap)

### The Operation
Eden led a joint Crown-Rookery extraction team into Vorthanis the Rendered's Lower Planes pocket realm. Mission: rescue Kethris Mournshadow (reformist Bhaal exarch) who'd been captured and used as ritual anchor for a mass-casualty threshold opening.

**Result:** 
- Kethris extracted alive (critical condition, Temple of Helm)
- Vorthanis banished to Lower Planes (alive but disrupted, will reform)
- Threshold permanently closed
- 4,000+ lives saved in Dock Ward
- Zero extraction team casualties
- Operation classified (no public recognition)

### Key Tactical Moments
- Nat 1 initiative (last to act, overcame through creativity)
- Disguise Self as Kethris for psychological warfare
- Nat 20 CON save vs Vorthanis's fear aura ("I'm not resisting. I'm just not interested")
- Chime of Opening destroyed 3 of 7 binding marks instantly
- Dimensional Anchor Ward blocked Vorthanis's teleportation
- Bead of Force trapped Vorthanis for 60 seconds (dirty 20 DEX save to avoid self-trap)
- Full extraction in ~60 seconds, pocket realm collapsed with Vorthanis inside

### The Big Character Moment
Eden defined his emerging role to his father: **"A librarian. Putting information in the hands of people who need it."**

Not a warrior. Not a spy. An **information broker/anchor point** - facilitating coordination between power structures that don't normally communicate (Crown, Rookery, reformist exarchs, etc.).

Aldrin recognized this as exactly what he's been doing for 20 years. It's also what Kethris does. It's what good intelligence work *is*.

**Key insight:** "Your independence is your power. Protect it."

## Current Situation

### Eden's Status
- **Level**: 2 Wizard (ready for Level 3 - two major story milestones completed)
- **HP**: 15/12 (temporarily over max from healing potion)
- **Spell Slots**: 2 of 3 first-level remaining
- **Off-Duty**: 48 hours ordered by Brecht
- **Next Assignment**: Write planar extraction procedures for Crown institutional knowledge

### Active Plot Threads

**Immediate (Next 48 Hours):**
- Tormund mentorship session (magical study, potential level-up)
- Aldrin's surveillance records review (37 years of data, volume 6 of *Planar Taxonomies*)
- Visit Kethris during recovery (debrief, coordination discussion)
- Define boundaries with multiple power structures
- Rest and process two planar extractions in one week

**Short-Term:**
- Kethris's recovery (weeks minimum, Temple of Helm)
- Lyren's integration (what role does she take?)
- Rookery partnership formalization (Vane's standing offer)
- Crown institutional planar knowledge building
- Write extraction procedures (Brecht's order)

**Medium-Term:**
- Vorthanis's reformation (hours to days, but no infrastructure to return)
- The other two reformist exarchs (who are they? will they coordinate?)
- Bhaal exarch schism management (3 reformists vs 3 remaining accelerationists)
- Building the "librarian" role operationally (what does information architecture look like?)

**Long-Term:**
- Vorthanis's personal vendetta ("This isn't over" - knows Eden by name)
- Preventing Bhaal's resurrection as indiscriminate slaughter god
- Maintaining independence while working with multiple factions
- Becoming the person who "controls the filing system"

### Key Relationships

**Allies/Mentors:**

## Player Preferences & Session Notes

### What Works
- Tactical thinking rewarded (misdirection over direct combat)
- Information gathering as primary tool
- Consequences for decisions (good and bad)
- Moral complexity (working with reformist Bhaal exarchs)
- Character agency (Eden chooses how to use his preparation)
- Fast-paced when appropriate (60-second extraction)
- Quiet victories (4,000 lives saved, no parade)

### What to Avoid
- **Speaking as Eden in dialogue** unless player indicates generalities (let player say Eden's actual words)
- Forcing combat when tactics could solve it
- Railroading toward specific solutions

- Removing consequences of player choices

### Player Interests
- **Intrigue and manipulation** (spies, getting in other guy's head, misdirection)
- **Information warfare** (knowledge as weapon, coordination as power)
- **Moral complexity** (working with "evil" factions for good outcomes)
- **The librarian/information broker role** (HECK YES - give me ALL of that)
- **Tactical creativity** (using environment, resources, psychology)
- **Character relationships** (especially Aldrin complexity, Kethris recognition)

### Recurring Themes Player Enjoys
- Arranged conclusions vs. arranged opportunities
- Being underestimated (level 2 beating level 6+)
- Using preparation time wisely (rituals, equipment, planning)
- Team coordination (trusting specialists, clear signals)
- Quiet competence over flashy heroics

## Tone & Style Notes

### What This Campaign Is
- Tactical fantasy with moral complexity
- Intelligence work with magical tools
- Character-driven with meaningful relationships
- Consequences matter (good and bad)
- "Competence porn" - watching smart people be smart
- Fast-paced when appropriate, contemplative when earned

### What This Campaign Isn't
- Power fantasy combat crawl
- Good vs. Evil morality tale
- "Chosen one" destiny narrative (Eden was *built*, not destined)

- Improv chaos (preparation and planning rewarded)

### Narrative Style
- Tight third-person limited (Eden's POV, world reacts)
- Detailed tactical descriptions (geometry matters)
- Emotional honesty (characters complex, not always likeable)
