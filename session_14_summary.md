# Session 14 Summary: The Thornhaven Mission
**Campaign**: The Thornhaven Shadow Crisis (Royal Court Arc)  
**Session Date**: 2026-02-22  
**In-Game Days**: Day 15-17 (The Journey)
**Session Length**: Epic - full mission arc with combat, negotiation, and homecoming

---

## Session Recap

After Days 13-14's romantic development and family bonding, Days 15-17 covered Eden's first solo operation: traveling to Thornhaven to meet the mysterious unknown watcher, discovering it was reformist exarch Vahlen the Warden, negotiating a divine oath, surviving two ambushes, and returning home early to people who missed him.

Also: Lyren learned enchantment magic in three days and used *Friends* cantrip to practice magically-enhanced flirting. She's a quick study.

---

## Day 15 - The Departure

**Morning Portent: 10 and 5**

Solid middle-ground. Good pass, good fail. Tactical flexibility.

### Saying Goodbye

**The Note from Lyren:**

Found under Eden's door. Her handwriting.

*"Don't die. Don't get mind-controlled. Don't make me use the divination I'm learning to track you doing something stupid. Come back in five days. We have a third date. And for the record - I'm still mad about the marriage comment but also kind of not. - L"*

**Aldrin's Gift:**

A leather journal. "For the journey. Your mother used to keep one. Said it helped her think."

**Lyren's Arrival:**

Ran to the gates. Out of breath. Carrying Tormund's *Principia Arcana*.

Wanted to say goodbye properly, not just with a note.

**Eden's Advice:**

*"Don't be afraid to browse the other chapters. I might not be afraid of a little enchantment."*

Gave her permission to learn MORE than just tracking divination. The whole book. Everything Tormund taught.

**The Kiss:**

Right there in front of Aldrin and Thorne and everyone. Quick but genuine.

**Lyren's Promise:**

"Five days. Be safe, be smart. If Vahlen is sketchy, walk away."

**The Departure:**

One last look back. Aldrin and Lyren watching. Both trying to look calm. Both failing.

Eden rode out through the palace gates.

### The Journey Begins

**Crown Security:**

Forces positioned in shifts along route. Discrete. Far enough to not spook contact, close enough to respond to cultist attacks.

**Temple Paladins:**

Disguised as travelers, merchants, guards. Blanket coverage without being obvious.

**Thorne's Detail:**

Traveling WITH Eden to Thornhaven outskirts. Only the final meeting would be alone.

**First Two Hours:**

Peaceful. Busy trade route. Merchants, travelers, normal traffic.

### The Waystation Diviner

**The Encounter:**

Two hours into journey. Small waystation. Water for horses.

A figure waiting. Traveler's cloak. **Strong divination aura.** Multiple active spells.

**Eden's Response:**

Cast Detect Magic (ritual, 10 minutes). Identified the figure as heavily magical.

Professional courtesy between diviners. Both scanning each other. Neither prying.

**The Warning:**

Diviner spoke casually: *"Long road to Thornhaven. Two days if you keep good pace. The road ahead remembers the last time you passed through."*

Then walked away. Heading back toward capital.

**The Meaning:**

Warning about the ambush site. Where cultists attacked Eden's team before.

Still dangerous. Be prepared.

**Eden's Theory:**

*"I have to assume whoever that guy was is related to the waiting party at our destination. My brain can't take another interloping faction."*

Someone backed by divine resources. Advance scout for the unknown watcher. Positioned to confirm Eden was coming and warn about threats.

### Midday - Village Inn

Lunch stop. Rest. Six hours into journey.

**Eden's Reflection:**

Writing in journal about the diviner. The warning. What it meant.

Theory forming: If unknown watcher (potentially Vahlen) positioned resources to ensure safe arrival, they're either genuinely invested or setting elaborate trap.

### Evening - Campsite

**First Night:**

Off main road. Defensible position. Watches set.

Eden wrote in journal. Processing the day. The departure. The warning.

*"Five days total. Four days until I see Lyren again."*

---

## Day 16 - The Ambush

**Morning Portent: 4 and 18**

Perfect for the dangerous day. Excellent success guarantee (18). Solid sabotage option (4).

### Morning Ride

Approaching the ambush site. The stretch where cultists attacked before.

**Detect Magic Cast:**

Eden ritual-cast while riding. 10 minutes. Active for 1 hour.

**What He Saw:**

Ahead - faint magical signatures. Multiple sources.

Getting closer:
- **Moderate Necromancy** (multiple sources, scattered in woods both sides)
- **Faint Divination** (someone scrying/watching)
- **Moderate Abjuration** (protective wards on ambushers)

**Eden's Order:**

*"Fang. Go around, off-trail, wide berth. Give me eyes and ears."*

### Fang's Reconnaissance

Through familiar bond:

**Left side of road:** 3 zombies hiding in brush

**Right side of road:** 2 zombies + 1 living cultist with scrying focus

**Total:** 5 zombies, 1 cultist (the divination source)

**Eden's Assessment:**

*"Five zombies and one living, scrying cultist. Unclear where he's scrying on, but he hasn't let on to seeing us. Three zombies left, two right. Cultist probably bound them - kill him, they lose coherence."*

**Thorne's Options:**

1. Signal backup - overwhelming force, loud
2. Coordinate with Temple for surgical strike
3. Bypass entirely
4. Eden's offensive magic + charge

**Eden's Decision:**

*"I've done bypassing before - those cultists took root in Room 9. Not leaving them at large again. Option 4."*

### The Counter-Ambush

**Preparation:**

All units take positions. Aim to kill.

Eden dismounts. Moves forward. Range for Flaming Sphere.

**The Attack:**

**FLAMING SPHERE cast** - 2nd level, 5-foot diameter, 30 feet ahead

**Bonus action: RAM** - straight at cultist

Cultist DEX save (DC 13): **Failed** (rolled 11)

**9 fire damage** - screaming, robes catching fire

**Fang launches** - claws and teeth to the face

Guards **CHARGE**

Temple paladins appear from north - **divine radiance**

### Combat Summary

**Initiative:** Eden rolled **Natural 20** (of course, when he didn't need it)

**Round 1:**
- **Eden:** Magic Missile (1st level) across 3 zombies (2, 2, 4 damage). Rammed Sphere again (9 fire damage to cultist)
- **Temple Paladins:** First paladin **killed cultist** with Divine Smite (17 damage). Others engaged zombies.
- **Thorne & Guards:** Engaged left-side zombies. Destroyed one.
- **Zombies:** Uncoordinated without controller. Ineffective attacks.

**Round 2:**
- Eden held back, moved Sphere defensively
- Paladins destroyed 2 more zombies
- Guards finished remaining zombies

**COMBAT OVER - Total time: ~20 seconds**

All zombies destroyed. Cultist dead.

**Casualties:** 1 Crown guard wounded (5 HP, minor)

### Searching the Body

**What Eden Found:**

**1. Scrying Focus** - Cracked crystal orb (divination, no longer functional)

**2. A Note** - Partially burned:

*"Investigator travels to Thornhaven. Ambush at old site. Kill or delay. Payment on proof. - V"*

Just "V." No other ID.

**3. Holy Symbol** - Bhaal's skull (confirmed cultist)

**4. Payment** - 15 gold pieces, **mixed origins:**
- 8 coins: Capital mint (20+ years old)
- 5 coins: Southern provinces (Caldreth)
- 2 coins: Foreign (eastern border)

**Analysis:**

Smuggler's gold. Untraceable. Professional payment.

Could be anyone with access to diverse currency: merchant, smuggler, someone with significant resources.

Or an exarch - divine entities accumulate wealth from anywhere over decades.

**The "V" Question:**

- Vahlen testing Eden?
- Different reformist?
- Someone trying to implicate Vahlen?
- Vorthanis sympathizers?
- Completely unrelated "V"?

**Temple Paladin's Assessment:**

Road ahead clear - patrolled this morning. But cultist group set up within last few hours.

Someone knew Eden was coming. Positioned specifically.

Either leak in security, or someone with their own divination.

### Afternoon Ride to Thornhaven

Continued journey. Four hours to arrival.

Peaceful. No more ambushes.

**Evening - Thornhaven Visible**

Sun setting. Golden light. Village ahead - same as Eden remembered.

**15 Minutes Out - Protocol Activation:**

Thorne halted group. Eden would continue alone from here.

**Fang's Advance Scout:**

*Village square clear. Few locals. No obvious threats. But...*

*Very strong magical signature at the old estate. Where you found Kethris.*

**The Signature:**

MUCH stronger than waystation diviner. Like TEN active spells. Multiple schools - divination, abjuration, transmutation, maybe necromancy.

Layered. Complex. **Exarch-level power.**

### The Estate Meeting

**Fang's Visual:**

Male figure. Older (50s-60s appearance). Robes. No weapon. Standing in main hall. Waiting.

Looking at the door like he KNOWS someone's coming.

Then looked directly at Fang's hiding spot.

Spoke: *"Tell your diviner he may enter. Alone. I mean no harm."*

**Eden's Assessment:**

*"Judging by strength and intricacy of signature, he could have done harm already. I'm going in."*

**Thorne's Precaution:**

Whistle. Three short blasts = extraction needed. Two-hour limit. If not back, assume compromise.

### Vahlen the Warden

**The Meeting:**

Eden entered the estate. Same room where Kethris was tortured.

Now clean. Empty except for one figure.

The man looked up. Smiled slightly.

**"Special Investigator Eden Sagebough. Thank you for coming. My name is Vahlen. The Warden. Third of the reformist exarchs."**

Two chairs positioned. Invitation to sit.

### The Negotiation

**Eden's Challenge:**

*"Judging by the fact you haven't obliterated me, I take it you truly mean no harm. But why ask me to come alone?"*

**Vahlen's Answer:**

*"Because trust must be established before alliance can be formed. And trust requires vulnerability."*

Alone = no guards to second-guess, no witnesses to perform for. Just honesty.

**Power Differential Acknowledged:**

*"If I meant harm, you would already be dead. I am an exarch. You are a third-level diviner. The power differential is significant. But I do not want your death. I want your partnership."*

**Eden's Follow-up:**

*"How are YOU vulnerable?"*

### Vahlen's Vulnerability

**Three Ways:**

**1. Identity Revealed:** No longer unknown shadow. Now Vahlen. Identified. Targetable.

**2. Asking for Alliance:** Needs Eden's cooperation. Eden could refuse. Leave him without the tactical asset he's been cultivating.

**3. Truth as Weapon:** Every piece of information shared is potential tool against him if Eden chooses.

**But Also - The Honest Threat:**

*"If you walk out, refuse alliance, and immediately report my location to hostile parties? Then yes. I would have to eliminate you. Not because I want to. Because I cannot allow you to become a liability."*

*"But if you simply say no and keep my location to yourself? Then you live. I disappear. We both move on."*

Truth. Unvarnished. No diplomatic deflection.

**Eden's Response:**

*"Then terms are set and we may begin."*

Sat down. Posturing over.

### What Vahlen Wants

**The Question:**

*"What need has an exarch for a third-level diviner?"*

**Vahlen's Answer:**

What Eden accomplished:
- Extracted Kethris from Vorthanis's custody (mortal walking into exarch operation)
- Eliminated three accelerationist exarchs simultaneously (unprecedented)

**The Value:**

*"You have tactical creativity unburdened by divine politics. You think like a mortal - small, quick, adaptable. You see solutions we miss."*

*"You also have legitimacy. Crown authority. Temple backing. When you act, it's not divine interference - it's mortal law enforcement."*

**What Vahlen Needs:**

*"Someone who can operate in the mortal world on behalf of reformist interests. Someone who can investigate, coordinate, execute operations impossible for an exarch to do directly."*

*"I need an agent. And you are the most effective mortal agent I have ever observed."*

### Eden's Concerns

**The Core Problem:**

*"You must understand the optics of openly working for a Bhaal exarch, and the logistics of secretly. I'm juggling several interested parties already. Give me your model of an agreement that fits my pre-existing commitments and accomplishes what you want, without tarnishing the Crown."*

**Vahlen's Model:**

- No formal alliance. No public acknowledgment.
- When threats align (reformist interests + Crown safety), Vahlen provides intelligence
- Eden investigates under Crown authority
- No contracts. No binding. Just mutual benefit when interests align.
- If interests DON'T align on specific issue, no cooperation. No obligation. No betrayal.

**Eden's Skepticism:**

*"That's a lot of 'no strings' that sounds like 'strings I haven't shown you yet.' I need something better than a wink, a nudge, and 'I haven't killed you yet.'"*

### The Binding Oath

**Vahlen's Offer:**

A binding oath. Sworn on divine nature. Real cost. Real consequence.

**Penalty for violation:** Loss of one-tenth divine essence. **Permanently.**

Significant power reduction. Would go from equal with Kethris/Mirthae to noticeably weaker.

**The Drafting:**

Vahlen wrote in Celestial. Eden cast Comprehend Languages (ritual) to read over his shoulder.

**Original Oath Terms:**

1. **No Harm Clause:** Won't deliberately cause physical/mental/spiritual harm to Eden, Aldrin, or Lyren (except direct self-defense or defense of other reformist exarchs)

2. **No Coercion:** Won't coerce, magically compel, or use divine influence to force Eden into actions contradicting Crown duties

3. **Truthful Intelligence:** Any information provided will be truthful and accurate to best of knowledge

4. **No Misuse of Trust:** Won't use Eden's trust, relationships, or position to harm Crown/Temple/Reformist interests without informed consent

5. **Penalty:** Violate any clause = forfeit 10% divine essence permanently

**Eden's Requests:**

**1. Add Kethris:** Vahlen added clause preventing harm to Kethris through manipulation of Eden

**2. Where does forfeited essence go?** Returns to Bhaal's domain but locked away. Inaccessible. Permanent loss of power.

### Performance Protocols

**Eden's Request:**

*"How will I know I'm discharging your agency well? I want protocols."*

Vahlen (amused): *"You want performance metrics. KPIs for being my mortal agent. That is the most Eden Sagebough thing I've heard all night."*

**The Protocols Document:**

**Success Criteria:**
- Vahlen provides intelligence on aligned threats
- Eden investigates using Crown authority
- If confirmed/actionable, Eden neutralizes
- Outcome benefits both Crown and reformist interests

**Good Standing Maintained By:**
- Honest assessment of intelligence (even if disagree)
- Transparent communication about Crown constraints
- Notification if can't act due to conflicting priorities
- Discretion regarding reformist sources/methods

**Good Standing NOT Dependent On:**
- Success rate (some threats unsolvable)
- Speed of response (bureaucracy understood)
- Choosing Crown over reformist when they conflict

**Poor Standing Indicated By:**
- Deliberately compromising reformist intelligence to hostile parties
- Using reformist info to harm reformist interests
- Publicly revealing arrangement without dire need

**Eden's Concern About Asymmetry:**

*"I notice you have explicit consideration - I don't. Is there a corresponding oath I'm expected to take? That doesn't seem fair."*

**Vahlen's Response:**

The asymmetry IS the point. He has overwhelming power, therefore he must be constrained.

Binding Eden would create servitude, not partnership.

What Vahlen wants: Willing cooperation. When interests align, act. When they don't, don't. No divine punishment for saying no.

**Eden's Final Concern:**

*"It still feels oddly unfair to bind one party while the other can renege. But I have to remind myself this power dynamic is not between equals. I'm satisfied."*

### Oath Activation

**The Ritual:**

Vahlen spoke in Celestial. Beautiful, resonant language carrying weight.

Parchment glowed golden. Script lifted off page, floating.

Vahlen's divine essence became visible - swirling gray and gold.

Words circled him. Sank INTO him. **Binding.**

He gasped - not pain, but weight of constraint settling onto divine nature.

**Five minutes. Done.**

Parchment marked with silver seal that wasn't there before.

**The Documents:**

Eden received both:
- The binding oath
- The performance protocols

To take to Brother Thaddeus for verification.

### The Warning

**Before Eden Left:**

Vahlen: *"The cultist ambush - the one signed 'V'? That wasn't me."*

**Eden:** *"Any idea who, All-Seeing One?"*

**Vahlen's Assessment:**

No definitive answer. Could be:
- Remaining Vorthanis loyalists
- Different accelerationist sympathizers
- Someone trying to implicate Vahlen
- Completely unrelated party

*"If I wanted you dead, I had better opportunities than hiring mediocre cultist with five zombies."*

**Advice:**

*"Assume hostile surveillance. Someone knew you were coming and when. Be careful on return journey. If they tried once, they might try again."*

### Parting Words

**Vahlen:**

*"Thank you. For trusting me enough to have this conversation."*

**Eden:**

*"Trust is hard to come by for an Investigator. Which is why I have to take it when I can get it, and test it to the Hells and back. This parchment is probably the closest to literal fulfillment of that I'll get for ten levels."*

**Vahlen (laughing):**

*"Ten levels. You're thinking long-term. Good. That oath will hold whether you're level three or level thirteen."*

*"Safe travels. I'll be in touch once Thaddeus verifies. Probably through less dramatic means than mysterious messages and solo meetings."*

**Time in Meeting:** Approximately 50 minutes (70 minutes left before extraction deadline)

---

## Day 16 Evening - Return Journey Begins

**Thorne's Report:**

While Eden was meeting Vahlen, scouts reported movement on road behind them. Potential hostile activity.

**Vahlen's Warning Confirmed:**

Someone still active. Watching for Eden's return.

**Route Decision:**

Two options:
1. Main road with backup (expected route, but Crown/Temple forces positioned)
2. Alternate route (longer, just protection detail, no backup)

**Eden's Choice:**

*"We take the main road. With backup positioned. If they want to ambush us, let them try with Temple paladins and Crown forces ready."*

Aggressive but smart. Better to fight with support.

### The "Unlikely" Jinx

**Eden's Fatal Words:**

After deciding to camp for the night:

*"It's unlikely there'd be a second set of assassins so close to that one."*

**Immediate Reaction:**

Thorne: *"Sir... you just INVITED trouble with that sentence."*

Guards: *"Never say 'it's unlikely' on a mission!"*

Fang: *"You absolute disaster."*

**The Response:**

Double watches. Extra vigilance. Expanded perimeter.

Everyone making pointed comments about "unlikely" and "famous last words."

**Eden's Attempted Fix:**

Tried to use Portent 18 to un-jinx the camp.

Fang informed him that's not how Portent works.

He tried anyway. It didn't work.

**Journal Entry:**

*"Then I said 'it's unlikely there'd be a second set of assassins' and immediately realized I'd jinxed us. Attempted to use Portent to un-jinx. Fang informed me that's not how Portent works. I tried anyway. It didn't work."*

*"Note to self: Stop saying things are 'unlikely.' The universe has OPINIONS about that."*

**The Night:**

Nothing happened. No attacks. No second assassins.

Camp remained peaceful.

Either the extra precautions worked, or there was never a threat.

Eden chooses to believe his tactical awareness saved them.

---

## Day 17 - The Second Ambush

**Morning Portent: 18 and 5**

Another 18 (two days in a row). Another low roll for sabotage.

The dice gods were being kind. Probably because Eden survived saying "unlikely" without consequence.

### Morning Departure

Temple paladins escorted first two hours, then returned to patrol routes.

Eden's group continued with just Thorne and protection detail.

**Four Hours from Capital:**

Lunch stop. Wayside inn. Quick meal.

**Thorne's Question:**

*"When we arrive, what's your plan? Report to Brecht first? Or see your personal connections?"*

**Eden's Response:**

*"I'll go to Brecht first. If anyone meets me on the way... I won't stop them."*

*"And let it be known - I DID attempt to use Portent to rectify my indecency. The Weave would have none of it. I shall just have to watch my tongue."*

**Guards' Reaction:**

*"Attempting to use divine prophecy to un-jinx yourself is possibly the most 'you' thing we've ever witnessed."*

*"Special Investigator, you're a tactical genius and a complete disaster simultaneously."*

### The Blockade

**Scout Report:**

Movement ahead. Something blocking the road. Maybe 15-20 minutes at current pace.

**Eden's Response:**

*"Fang, stay ahead but in sense-sharing range. We'll slow down so I can put up Detect Magic."*

**Detect Magic Active:**

Ritual cast while riding (10 minutes). Completed 8 minutes before contact.

**What Eden Saw:**

- **Moderate Evocation** (one caster, offensive magic ready)
- **Faint Necromancy** (multiple sources - undead or death-touched equipment)
- **Faint Abjuration** (protective wards on several figures)

**Fang's Visual:**

Not cultists. **Professional military types.** Organized formation. Armor (mismatched but quality).

6-7 fighters + 1 caster.

**Eden's Assessment:**

*"Professional military. Not loosely-organized zealots. At least one caster."*

**Thorne's Analysis:**

Mercenaries. Someone paid good coin for organized fighters.

### The Counter-Ambush (Part 2)

**Eden's Strategy:**

*"Signal Temple paladins to fall in behind the blockade, silently. If we charge, we can rout them."*

**Silent Signal:**

Thorne used mirror, moonlight. Three quick flashes. Specific pattern.

Distant answering flash. Message received. Paladins moving to surround.

**Stall Tactic - The Light Flare:**

Eden pulled out a pebble (from component pouch, collected earlier). Cast **Light** cantrip. Threw it high like signal flare.

**BLAZED** with bright light. Illuminated entire area.

**What It Revealed:**

7 figures behind crude blockade:
- 6 armored fighters (quality gear)
- 1 robed caster (back position)

**Mercenary Reaction:**

Light caught them off-guard. Hands up to shield eyes. Formation wavered.

Caster: *"IT'S A SIGNAL! THEY HAVE BACKUP!"*

Professional enough to recognize tactical disadvantage.

**Thorne:** *"CHARGE! Before they scatter!"*

Temple paladins emerged from behind. **Surrounded.**

Mercenaries froze. Smart enough to know when beaten.

Leader (older, scarred): *"HOLD! We're done!"*

**COMBAT AVOIDED - SURRENDER**

Weapons dropped. Completely surrounded.

Total time: Maybe 20 seconds from flare to surrender.

### Interrogation

**The Leader - Harrick:**

Professional. Grizzled. No fear despite sword at throat.

**Who Hired Them:**

*"Hired three days ago. Paid half up front. Job: delay or capture Special Investigator on return from Thornhaven. Alive if possible. Dead if necessary."*

Came through broker in capital. Professional job - don't ask questions.

Payment: **Mixed-origin gold. Untraceable.** Same as cultist from earlier.

**The Broker:**

Name: **Tavin Coors**

Location: **The Gilt Serpent** (tavern, merchant district)

Mid-40s, balding, always wears green. Specializes in discrete contracts.

**Delivery Instructions:**

If captured Eden, deliver to contact point. Eastern road, two days' ride.

**Harrick's Assessment:**

*"We're professionals, Investigator. Not zealots. We took a job. It went bad. We're done."*

### The Deal

**Eden (via Message to Thorne):**

*"Inclined to offer clemency - look the other way - if they help us find their broker."*

**Thorne's Official Offer:**

Crown law allows clemency for cooperation. But needs:
- Actionable intelligence on broker
- Testimony if required
- Full cooperation

**Harrick's Terms:**

*"Testimony means we're targets. Want it in writing. Signed by Crown official."*

Deal: Give broker info + testify = clemency + Crown protection during testimony + free to leave kingdom after.

**The Evidence:**

Harrick provided:
- Wooden token (Gilt Serpent calling card with "TC" carved on back - Tavin's personal mark)
- Info: Advance payment came in leather pouch with serpent symbol
- Verification method: Show token at Gilt Serpent, mention Harrick's name
- Tactical advice: Tavin comes every third evening, sits in back corner, green vest

**Why Help Beyond Required:**

*"Because you're letting us walk. And because whoever hired us tried to get us killed by lying about the job."*

Professional courtesy.

**Eden's Response:**

*"Reasonable men, this lot."*

**Harrick:** *"We're reasonable because we're professionals. Dying for a paycheck is bad business."*

**The Release:**

Evidence sufficient. Mercenaries collected gear. Walked off into darkness.

Temple paladin: *"Did we just let assassins go?"*

Thorne: *"We let contractors go who provided valuable intelligence. There's a difference."*

### Camping & Return

**Decision:**

Camp for night. Eight hours to capital at normal pace. Leave at dawn, arrive mid-afternoon Day 17.

Still ahead of five-day deadline (Day 19).

**The Intel Gathered:**

- Two ambushes. Both paid by "V"
- Same untraceable mixed-origin gold
- Professional broker: Tavin Coors at Gilt Serpent
- Someone with deep pockets and good intelligence
- Knew Eden's route, timing, security arrangements

**Harrick's Warning:**

*"Whoever's paying has deep pockets and good intelligence. That's not amateur work. Watch your back. This isn't over."*

---

## Day 17 - Homecoming

**Dawn Departure**

Normal pace. Eight hours ahead.

Heavily-patrolled Crown territory. Safer ground.

**Midday - Four Hours Out**

Approaching the capital. City visible.

Home.

### The Waiting Party

**At the Gates:**

Aldrin. Standing with scholarly posture. Relief visible when he spotted Eden.

Lyren. Holding Tormund's *Principia Arcana*. **Heavily bookmarked.** Multiple pages flagged.

Both positioned to see arrival. Not intercepting, but definitely watching.

**Eden's Message:**

Cast Message to Lyren. Not words - just the **feeling of a wink.** Playful. Glad to see her.

She jumped. Hand to ear. Looked up. Spotted him. **Grinned.**

Mouthed: *"Show off."*

Called out louder: *"Hi, Dad! Home early!"*

**Aldrin's Hug:**

Quick, tight. Relief. *"Three days. You said five. Don't scare me like that."*

**Lyren's Book:**

Heavily bookmarked. She'd been STUDYING.

*"You're back. Early. And in one piece."*

*"And I may have learned more than just tracking divination. The enchantment chapter was very interesting."*

### Reporting to Brecht

**The Journal Drop:**

Eden handed Brecht the journal Aldrin gave him. Full account of:
- The Vahlen meeting
- The binding oath
- Both ambushes
- Mercenary intel on broker

Brecht: *"This is very thorough."*

**Next Steps:**

- Brother Thaddeus will verify oath tomorrow
- Brecht will investigate Tavin Coors quietly
- Full debrief tomorrow morning (ninth bell)

Brecht: *"Well done. This is solid work."*

### The Conservatory

Lyren pulled Eden there. Same place as first kiss.

Empty. Afternoon sunlight. Fountain burbling.

**What She Learned:**

*"I learned tracking divination first, like you said. Monitored you the whole time. Very responsible."*

Tracked the entire journey. Saw:
- Meeting someone in Thornhaven (HUGE magical signature)
- Two attempted ambushes on return

*"I was productive with my worry."*

**Then:**

*"I got curious about other chapters. The enchantment one caught my eye."*

### The *Friends* Cantrip

**Demonstration:**

Lyren cast *Friends* - enchantment cantrip that makes caster temporarily more charming/persuasive.

Her eyes flashed. Voice had QUALITY to it. More compelling.

*"So. Special Investigator. You've been gone for three days. I missed you."*

Eden could SENSE the enchantment (he's a diviner). Recognized what she was doing.

**Eden's Response:**

*"Somehow, you got even hotter. This is a cantrip? You foul seductress~"*

**Lyren (laughing, dropping spell):**

*"Did you just call me a 'foul seductress' while COMPLIMENTING the spell?"*

*"You're using MAGIC to be more charming! That's cheating!"*

*"It's ENCHANTMENT! It's a legitimate school of magic!"*

### The Tracking & Reading Minds

**What Lyren Noticed:**

Through tracking divination - not thoughts exactly, but presence. Where Eden's attention was.

*"During the Vahlen meeting, there were spikes of awareness. Like you were checking in. Making sure I was okay even though you were the one in danger."*

Not enchantment. Just Eden being tactically aware of people he cares about.

**The Marriage Comment:**

*"I WAS thinking about it. Not obsessively. Just sometimes. When I was tracking you and wondering if you'd come back safe."*

*"Still scary and too soon. But also... nice to think about. Eventually. Far future. When we're not disasters."*

### The Strings Conversation

**Eden's Confession:**

Told Lyren about negotiating with Vahlen. The binding oath. The asymmetry of power.

*"I told him I can't afford 'no strings' that are actually 'invisible strings', because I can't get them tangled with Dad. With Kethris. With you. I'm not the Hero of Thornhaven anymore because I have strings."*

Stroked her hair to emphasize the last "strings."

**Lyren's Response:**

*"Strings. You told an exarch you have strings now. People you care about. Things worth protecting."*

*"And you included me in that. With your dad and Kethris. As a reason to be careful. As something that matters."*

Processing: *"I did the same thing. Every time the signature showed danger, I thought 'he has to come back. We have a third date. He promised.'"*

*"We're both disasters who got strings attached very fast."*

**The Agreement:**

It's scary and new and too fast. But also exactly right. For them.

Kiss. Soft and sure.

*"Welcome home. You kept your promise. You came back."*

*"I had strings pulling me here."*

### The Book Debate

**Eden:** *"Return? No! You're in too deep now. You've got to put me under a Geas before you can put that book down."*

**Lyren (laughing):** *"A Geas? That's FIFTH-LEVEL magic! I've been studying for THREE DAYS!"*

*"Then you better keep studying until you can cast it."*

*"Fine. I'll keep it. But when I DO learn Geas, I'm using it to make you stop saying things are 'unlikely' during missions."*

*"That's a waste of a fifth-level spell slot."*

*"That's SAVING YOUR LIFE."*

### Walking to the Archives

Hand in hand. She's still holding Tormund's book. He's still holding her hand.

Fang: *You two are disgustingly sweet. Your father is waiting.*

**Aldrin's Greeting:**

Saw them together. Smiled.

*"Welcome back, son. Successfully negotiated with an exarch, I hear?"*

## Character Development

### Eden's Evolution

**From Lone Operator to Someone With Strings:**

Two weeks ago: Just him and Aldrin. No attachments beyond father.

Now: Negotiating with exarchs while thinking about Lyren. Telling divine entities "I have strings now."

**Tactical Growth:**

- Professional counter-ambush execution (both times)
- Clemency negotiation with mercenaries (pragmatic, effective)
- Divine contract navigation (recognized asymmetry, requested protocols)
- Light flare tactic (creative use of cantrip)

**Emotional Maturity:**

- Writing in journal to process (using gift from father)
- Acknowledging Lyren matters enough to affect exarch negotiations
- Understanding "strings" as strength, not weakness
- Coming home to people who missed him (and being glad about it)

**The Jinx Incident:**

Peak disaster energy. Said "unlikely," realized mistake, tried to FIX IT WITH MAGIC, failed, wrote about it in journal.

Never living it down.

### Lyren's Development

**Magical Prodigy:**

Learned tracking divination in days 1-2. Then enchantment. Then probably other things.

*Friends* cantrip mastered well enough to use it flirtatiously.

Tormund's book heavily bookmarked. Multiple advanced chapters explored.

**The Productive Worry:**

Instead of passive anxiety, active monitoring. Tracked Eden entire journey. Saw both ambushes. Noticed when his attention spiked (checking in on her during Vahlen meeting).

**Processing Strings:**

Acknowledged she was thinking about marriage comment too. Not obsessively, but sometimes.

Recognized they're both disasters who got attached fast. Decided that's okay.

### Aldrin & Vahlen (Brief Appearances)

**Aldrin:**

Gave journal. Waited at gates. Relief when Eden returned early.

Second tea date with Kethris upcoming (mentioned).

**Vahlen:**

Professional. Direct. Bound himself significantly for alliance.

Acknowledged power differential honestly. Offered real cost for trust.

Will be in touch after Thaddeus verification.

---

## Relationships

### Eden & Lyren

**Status:** "Whatever this is" with acknowledged strings

**Progress:**
- She tracked him magically for three days
- He thought about her during exarch negotiations
- Both acknowledged they're "strings" for each other
- Marriage comment still being processed (scary but not terrible)
- Enchantment flirting now part of the relationship

**The Dynamic:**

She learns magic at terrifying speed and uses it playfully.

He overthinks everything and tries to fix mistakes with Portent.

Both disasters. Both attached. Both okay with that.

### Eden & Vahlen

**Status:** Conditional alliance pending Thaddeus verification

**Terms:**
- Binding oath (10% essence penalty for violation)
- Performance protocols (KPIs for agent work)
- Intelligence sharing when interests align
- No obligation when interests don't align

**The Understanding:**

Power differential acknowledged. Vahlen constrained because he's the powerful one.

Eden gets divine-level intelligence. Vahlen gets effective mortal operator.

Professional arrangement with real stakes.

### Eden & The Guards

**Status:** Respectful camaraderie with gentle mockery

They will NEVER let him live down:
- The "unlikely" jinx
- Attempting to Portent-fix it
- Being "tactical genius and complete disaster simultaneously"

But also: They trust him. Follow his orders. Respect his decisions.

---

## Themes Explored

### Trust and Vulnerability

**Vahlen's Lesson:**

Trust requires vulnerability. Being alone = no performance, just honesty.

Power differential means the powerful must be constrained.

**Eden's Application:**

Asked for binding oath. Requested protocols. Acknowledged asymmetry but proceeded.

Trust, but verify. And document.

### Strings as Strength

**Eden's Realization:**

Having people who matter isn't weakness. It's reason to be careful. To come home. To negotiate smart.

**The Vahlen Negotiation:**

Literally told an exarch "I can't afford invisible strings because they'll tangle with my strings (Dad, Kethris, Lyren)."

Made relationship attachments part of tactical consideration.

**Lyren's Mirror:**

Did the same thing. Tracked him thinking "he has to come back, we have a third date."

### Professional Standards

**The Mercenaries:**

Not zealots. Contractors. Professionals with standards.

When job went bad (lied about backup), they cooperated. Business dispute, not ideological war.

**Harrick's Philosophy:**

*"Dying for a paycheck is bad business."*

Reasonable. Pragmatic. Gave extra intel out of professional courtesy.

### Magic as Communication

**The Light Flare:**

Cantrip as tactical signal. Creative problem-solving.

**The Message Wink:**

Spell used to send feeling instead of words. Playful intimacy.

**The Friends Cantrip:**

Enchantment as flirtation. Magic as love language.

### Jinxing Yourself

**The "Unlikely" Incident:**

Said it. Recognized mistake immediately. Tried to fix with MAGIC.

Everyone mocked him. He wrote about it in journal. Will never be forgotten.

But also: no actual consequences (this time).

Lesson learned: Watch your tongue. The universe has opinions.

## Magic & Mechanics

### Portent Usage

**Day 15:** 10, 5 (unused)

**Day 16:** 4, 18
- Used 18 on nothing (tried to un-jinx camp, didn't work)
- Saved 4 for combat (never needed it)

**Day 17:** 18, 5
- Both unused (no combat, early arrival)

Strategic conservation. Professional discipline.

### Combat Spells

**First Ambush:**
- Flaming Sphere (2nd level) - 9 damage twice to cultist
- Magic Missile (1st level) - 2, 2, 4 to zombies

**Second "Combat":**
- Light (cantrip) - tactical signal flare
- No actual fighting (surrender on approach)

### Ritual Casting

**Detect Magic:** Cast twice during journey (10 min ritual each time)

Provided advance warning both ambushes. Essential intel.

**Comprehend Languages:** Cast during oath drafting

Read Celestial contract in real-time. Verified terms before binding.

### New Cantrip Learned (by Lyren)

**Friends:** Enchantment cantrip. Make yourself more charming/persuasive for 1 minute.

Lyren mastered it in three days. Used it to practice magically-enhanced flirting.

Eden could sense it (diviner detecting enchantment). Found it both impressive and slightly terrifying.

## Intelligence Gathered

### The "V" Connection

**Two Ambushes. Same Pattern:**

1. Cultist attack (Day 16) - signed "V", untraceable gold
2. Mercenary attack (Day 16/17) - hired through broker, same type of gold

**Payment Analysis:**

Mixed-origin coins. Deliberately untraceable. Professional payment method.

Suggests:
- Significant resources
- Access to diverse currency
- Understanding of how to avoid detection

**Possible "V" Identities:**

- Vahlen (testing Eden) - **unlikely**, he warned about attacks
- Vorthanis loyalists (revenge for leader's death)
- Different accelerationist sympathizers
- Someone trying to implicate Vahlen (using his initial)
- Completely different party

### The Broker

**Tavin Coors:**

- Operates from **The Gilt Serpent** (tavern, merchant district)
- Mid-40s, balding, always wears green
- Specializes in discrete contracts
- Has personal calling cards (wooden tokens with "TC" mark)
- Appears every third evening, back corner table

**Verification Method:**

Show token at Gilt Serpent. Mention Harrick's name. Staff will confirm.

**Next Steps:**

Brecht investigating quietly. Potential sting operation.

### Intelligence Quality Assessment

**Vahlen's Advance Scout:**

Positioned at waystation. Warned about ambush site. Professional.

Indicates Vahlen has:
- Extensive surveillance capabilities
- Resources to position agents along routes
- Genuine interest in Eden's safe arrival

**The Ambushes:**

Someone knew:
- Eden's route (specific roads)
- Timing (when he'd be traveling)
- Security arrangements (tried to account for backup)

Either:
- Leak in Crown/Temple security
- Independent divination capabilities
- Inside information from someone with access

---

## Unresolved Threads

### The Binding Oath

**Status:** Pending verification

Brother Thaddeus reviewing tomorrow. Will confirm:
- Binding is legitimate
- Terms are as stated
- No hidden loopholes
- Penalty mechanism valid

**If Verified:**

Alliance proceeds. Eden becomes Vahlen's mortal agent (when interests align).

**If Problems Found:**

Renegotiation. Or decline entirely.

### The Broker Investigation

**Brecht's Task:**

Quietly investigate Tavin Coors. Gilt Serpent surveillance.

Potential approaches:
- Undercover agent posing as client
- Direct confrontation
- Monitor contacts to identify "V"

**Risk:**

If broker disappears, lose connection to whoever's funding attacks.

### The "V" Identity

**Critical Question:**

Who has:
- Resources for professional mercenaries
- Access to untraceable gold
- Intelligence on Eden's movements
- Motive to prevent Eden-Vahlen alliance

**Investigation Paths:**

- Track broker's contacts
- Analyze payment sources (if possible)
- Monitor for additional attempts
- Cross-reference with exarch politics

### Third Date

**Promised:**

Eden and Lyren. After he returned.

**Status:**

He's back early. Two days ahead of schedule.

**Lyren's Promise:**

*"I'm going to tease you about the marriage comment the ENTIRE time."*

Eden: *"I regret everything."*

Lyren: *"No you don't. You have strings now. You're stuck with me."*

### Aldrin & Kethris

**Second Tea Date:**

Scheduled for this week (mentioned).

Progress of their relationship ongoing.

Both learning to be people again instead of just roles.
