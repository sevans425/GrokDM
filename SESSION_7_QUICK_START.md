    15	### The Story So Far (3 Sentences)
    16	Eden Sagebough prevented an apocalyptic Bhaal cult ritual, was appointed Special Investigator to the Crown, and has spent the past day building tactical and magical infrastructure. In Session 6, he detected a cultist surveilling the palace, designed a comprehensive counter-operation using body doubles and sleep deprivation tactics, formalized his partnership with merchant Blackwater, and spent five hours studying magical theory in the Royal Archives. Three Bhaal cultists are now trapped under surveillance at a Dock Ward boarding house while decoy operations are about to begin.

   167	
   168	## Session 7 Opening Scene
   169	
   170	Dawn breaks over the Royal Palace, Day 6. Eden wakes to the sound of activity—guards changing shifts, preparations for the decoy operation beginning, the palace coming to life.
   171	
   172	**Sergeant Thorne knocks**: "Lord Sagebough, Archmage Tormund sent word—the enchanted bracelets are ready. The decoy teams are assembling in the guard barracks. Commander Brecht requests your presence for final briefing before deployment."
   173	
   174	**Also**: A messenger from Blackwater arrived with the first intelligence report from the boarding house surveillance.
   175	
   176	**And**: Your father mentions Professor Verin sent word he's available at the Archives today for your first practical divination lesson, if you want it.
   177	
   178	**Multiple opportunities, all beginning simultaneously.**
   179	
   180	**Immediate Priorities**:
   181	- Attend decoy operation briefing (see the bracelets, meet the body doubles, confirm plans)
   182	- Read Blackwater's intelligence report (what did overnight surveillance reveal?)
   183	- Decide: Stay involved in operations, or continue magical education while trap runs?
   184	- Coordinate with protection detail on today's movements
   185	
   186	**Session Goals**:
   187	1. See decoy operations launch and initial results
   188	2. Observe effects of sleep deprivation on cultists (via intelligence reports)
   189	3. Potential: Cultist attempt on decoy or Eden
   190	4. Continue magical education (divination lesson with Verin?)
   191	5. Manage multiple operations simultaneously
   192	6. Prepare for tomorrow's meeting with Tormund about grimoire transcription
   193	
   194	---
   195	
   196	## Important Character Notes
   197	
   198	**Eden's Tactical Philosophy**: "I'm building a chokepoint around my lack of confidence—they need me, and the less they can think, the less creative they can be about circumventing our plans. They're on a divine time limit. They'll walk into the trap eventually, but it won't be me trapping them—it'll be a host of others. I'm just the target."
   199	
   200	**Delegation as Strategy**: Eden copes with overwhelming responsibility by distributing tasks to experts, creating "a little crowded workspace I can predict."
   201	
   202	**Magical Focus**: Identified divination and illusion as ideal for investigator-wizard. Wants to understand *why* magic works, not just *how*.
   203	
   204	**Politics Paradox**: Hates court politics but excels at it; exhausted by social performance but remarkably skilled.
   205	
   206	**Protection Detail**: Now part of daily life; Eden prefers minimal interference but accepts necessity.
   207	
   208	---
   209	
   210	## Key Relationships
   211	
   212	**Tormund**: Deep mentorship, loaned personal journal, crafting enchantments for Eden's operations; will teach combat magic (evocation/abjuration); meeting tomorrow about grimoire transcription
   213	
   214	**Professor Verin**: New divination mentor; enthusiastic about teaching investigative magic; available at Archives
   215	
   216	**Blackwater**: Formalized partnership with mutual respect; 20+ informants working for Eden; running sleep deprivation operation
   217	
   218	**Father**: Supporting Eden while exploring retirement; making Archives connections; proud of son's development
   219	
   220	**Protection Detail**: Professional relationship with Thorne's team; they respect Eden's tactical mind
   221	
   222	**King**: Trusts Eden's judgment enough to approve unconventional operations
   223	
   224	---
   225	
   226	## DM Reminders for Session 7
   227	
   228	### Pacing & Tone
   229	- Balance multiple simultaneous operations (can't be everywhere at once)
   230	- Show effects of Eden's planning paying off (or complications arising)
   231	- Opportunity for both action (cultist confrontation?) and development (divination lessons)
   232	- Let Eden choose focus: operations management or magical education
   233	
   234	### Sleep Deprivation Effects (Cultists)
   235	Day 1 effects should begin showing:
   236	- Irritability, shorter tempers
   237	- Small mistakes in routine (staying visible longer, sloppy surveillance)
   238	- Possible arguments among the three cultists
   239	- Degraded decision-making starting to appear
   240	
   241	### Decoy Operation Possibilities
   242	- Cultist watches a decoy, believes it's Eden
   243	- Cultist spots both decoy and real Eden, realizes trap
   244	- Cultist attempts strike on decoy (capture opportunity)
   245	- Cultists do nothing day 1 (still assessing)
   246	- Unexpected complication or contingency from cultists
   247	
   248	### Character Development
   249	- Eden learning to manage operations from distance (delegation in practice)
   250	- Balancing investigator instincts (want to be in field) with Special Investigator role (coordinate others)
   251	- Beginning divination education (new magical capabilities)
   252	- Protection detail becoming normalized part of life
   253	
   254	### Key Beats to Consider
   255	1. Decoy operation briefing (see Tormund's craftsmanship, meet body doubles)
   256	2. Blackwater's intelligence report (what did surveillance reveal overnight?)
   257	3. First day of operations running (reports coming in, adjustments needed?)
   258	4. Optional: Divination lesson with Verin (new magical perspective)
   259	5. Optional: Cultist makes a move (action sequence)
   260	6. Evening: Assessment of day 1 results, plan adjustments for day 2
