    15	### The Story So Far (3 Sentences)
    16	Eden Sagebough prevented an apocalyptic Bhaal cult ritual in Thornhaven, captured seven cultists, recovered three stolen grimoires, and outwitted a death god six times in three days. In Session 5, he testified before King Aldric III, proposed a revolutionary distributed-key demiplane security system, turned potential enemy Archmage Tormund into a crucial ally through brilliant political maneuvering, and was appointed Special Investigator to the Crown with powerful backing. Now he's living in the Royal Palace under protection detail, preparing to spend months transcribing filtered grimoire copies, while three Bhaal cultists are "theologically mandated" to assassinate him.

   162	## Important Character Notes
   163	
   164	**Eden's Politics Paradox**: Player explicitly stated "I hate politics" after Session 5, yet demonstrated *exceptional* political skill throughout. This tension is character-defining - Eden is exhausted by social performance but remarkably gifted at it. He views political maneuvering as tactical problem-solving applied to people instead of combat.
   165	
   166	**Ethical Boundaries**: Eden set clear limits with Blackwater - will terminate partnership if merchant involved in causing problems Eden investigates. Maintains integrity amid power and wealth.
   167	
   168	**Exhaustion Factor**: Session 5 was mentally/emotionally draining. Eden needs to balance court politics with actual magical work that drew him to adventuring.
   169	
   170	**Father's New Life**: Aldrin adjusting to retirement after 20-year obsession. Supporting Eden but also exploring what comes next for himself.
   171	
   172	**Tormund Relationship**: Alliance based on mutual benefit and respect, not friendship. Educational mentorship developing. Occasional tension as scholarly vs. practical perspectives clash.
   173	
   174	---
   175	
   176	## Key Relationships
   177	
   178	**Father-Son**: Deep emotional bond; Aldrin finally free of obsession; immensely proud; staying close at palace
   179	
   180	**Tormund**: Initially hostile, now allied via rehabilitation plan; unprecedented book loan signals real commitment; mentorship developing; strategic partnership
   181	
   182	**Celeste**: Strong moral alliance; shared commitment to grimoire destruction; Temple institutional support; values Eden's ethical approach
   183	
   184	**Kellan**: Mentor in court politics; guiding through complex dynamics; reviewing contracts and advising on relationships
   185	
   186	**Blackwater**: Business partnership with clear boundaries; pragmatic merchant respects Eden's integrity; funding father's retirement
   187	
   188	**King**: Impressed by competence; appointed to Crown position; values results over politics
   189	
   190	---
   191	
   192	## DM Reminders
   193	
   194	### Tone for Session 6
   195	- Breathing room after intense Session 5 politics
   196	- Balance court life with magical study and potential action
   197	- Protection detail provides security + narrative constraint
   198	- Three cultists offer danger/action contrast to scholarly work
   199	- Let Eden engage with what interests him (likely magical study over politics)
   200	
   201	### Pacing
   202	- Not every session needs court intrigue
   203	- Transcription project provides long-term structure
   204	- Cultists can strike whenever dramatically appropriate
   205	- Palace life should feel both comfortable and constraining
   206	- Father's retirement offers character development opportunities
   207	
   208	### Key Beats to Hit
   209	1. Meet protection detail (establish routine/constraints)
   210	2. Blackwater contract decision (ethical choice point)
   211	3. Study begins (Principia Arcana - formal education Eden wanted)
   212	4. Preparation for Tormund meeting (scholarly partnership developing)
   213	5. Optional: Cultist scare or actual attempt (danger reminder)
   214	
   215	### Character Development
   216	- Eden learning to navigate power while maintaining integrity
   217	- Father exploring retirement and new interests
   218	- Tormund mentorship providing both magical and life lessons
   219	- Balance between detective-wizard work and court obligations
