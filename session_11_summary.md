# Session 11 Summary
**Campaign**: The Thornhaven Shadow Crisis (Royal Court Arc)  
**Session Date**: 2026-02-18  
**In-Game Date**: Day 9 (dawn through evening)  
**Session Length**: Full day - downtime activities, relationship building, intelligence coordination

---

## Session Recap

Session 11 was a masterclass in infrastructure building and network management. No combat, no life-or-death stakes, just Eden methodically building the information architecture that will sustain his long-term operations. From breakfast with his father to gaming out conversations with Augury, Eden spent Day 9 establishing the systems that will keep him alive when Vorthanis comes calling.

### Dawn: First Real Portent

**Day 9 Portent Roll: 18 and 20**

Eden's first real Portent casting after achieving Level 3. Two exceptionally powerful results - an 18 (reliable success) and a natural 20 (guaranteed critical/auto-success).

**The Temptation:**
Immediately present. These numbers could optimize everything today. But Eden held to Tormund's rubric:
1. Someone will die if I don't use it
2. Mission fails catastrophically if I don't use it
3. That's it - those are the only two reasons

**The Discipline:**
Eden wrote them down. Put the dice away. Saved them. Spent the entire day with two incredibly powerful options available and never touched them.

**Aldrin's Question (at breakfast):**
"Are you afraid you'll waste them? Or afraid you'll *need* them?"

Both. The paradox of preparation.

---

## Breakfast with Father

Eden brought food from Marta (palace night kitchen). Sat down with Aldrin for actual breakfast before business. First peaceful father-son moment since reunion.

### The Surveillance Ward Modification

Worked together to modify Aldrin's wards to send a message back to the unknown watcher:

**Message Content:**
*"Surveillance acknowledged. State operational interest for potential coordination assessment."*

Not threatening. Not submissive. Professional acknowledgement between intelligence operators.

**The Work:**
- Eden maintained ward structure (concentration practice)
- Aldrin inscribed modifications
- One hour of coordinated magical work
- Father-son partnership, literally building together

**Next Steps:**
Unknown watcher will receive message next time they probe (likely within a week based on pattern). Ball in their court.

### Aldrin's Surveillance Records

**"Volume 6 of Planar Taxonomies"** - 37 years of surveillance detection data.

**Key Entries Reviewed:**

**Unknown Signature #1 (1291-1293):**
- First appeared 2 years into grimoire investigation
- Aggressive probing, necromancy-tinged
- 11 attempts over 3 years
- Pattern matches Vorthanis's known magical signature
- Stopped when investigation went cold
- **Returned 18 months ago** (right when Aldrin was finalizing Thornhaven coordination)

**Conclusion:** Vorthanis has known about Aldrin for at least 13 years, possibly longer.

**The Rookery (1294-present):**
- Started monthly surveillance 5 years into investigation
- Professional, non-hostile assessment
- Watched for 8 years before making contact
- 1302: Facilitated introduction with Kethris
- Became cooperative rather than surveillance-only
- Pattern: assess → position → coordinate when advantageous

**Quote from Aldrin:**
*"Partners who maintain independence are more valuable than assets they control."*

**Unknown Signature #2 (Recent - 2 weeks ago):**
- Started when Eden became operationally visible
- Extremely sophisticated, unidentifiable
- NOT Vorthanis, NOT Rookery, NOT Crown
- Weekly pattern, learning defenses
- Most recent attempt: 11 days ago (day before Room 9 extraction)

**Critical:** Someone new started watching specifically because of Eden's visibility.

### Mother's Journal

Aldrin offered Eden his mother's journal. She knew about the 20-year preparation. Knew Aldrin was building Eden's capabilities deliberately.

**Key Entry Shown:**
*"Eden asked today why people steal things. Not toys from other children - he understands that. He's asking about the philosophical motivation for theft of dangerous knowledge. He's seven. I told Aldrin this is too much too fast. He said 'he asked the question, I'm just answering honestly.' And he's right. The boy did ask. But gods, the weight we're putting on him."*

She worried. She understood. She chose to let it happen while making sure Aldrin knew the cost.

**Eden's Response:**
*"Then I know that the decision to make me into who I am was made with love and understanding from the both of you. That's all I need to know."*

Didn't need to read the whole journal. Just needed to know it wasn't manipulation without care.

### The Hug

After learning about the surveillance, the wards, the journal - Eden said: *"Thank you, Dad."* 

Hugged him.

Aldrin held on. Twenty years of preparation, manipulation, guilt, and love compressed into that moment.

When he released: *"Come back when you can. For breakfast or business or both."*

## Tormund's Training Session

### Flaming Sphere Practice

**Goal:** Learn concentration maintenance under fire, test limits, understand how to break enemy concentration.

**Setup:**
- Clear practice room
- Fang to safe perch
- Tormund with bag of cloth projectiles
- "I'm going to be throwing things"

**Round 1: Basic Control**
- Cast Flaming Sphere (2nd-level slot)
- Move on command, track Tormund
- Use as mobile area denial
- Tormund throws projectiles to force CON saves

**Results:**
- Single hits: maintained easily (concentration exercises paid off)
- Two rapid hits: held through both (impressive)
- Three rapid hits in quick succession: **Failed on natural 1**

**Lesson Learned:** Can maintain through two saves consistently. Three saves in one round? Concentration breaks. That's the current limit.

**Tormund:** *"Most level 3 casters drop on the first or second. You maintained through TWO before failing."*

**Round 2: Second Casting**
- Used second 2nd-level slot
- Same drill, escalated difficulty
- Saves: 11 (success), 10 (exactly meets DC), Nat 1 (failure)

Same result. Two saves is the threshold. Three breaks it.

**Tactical Takeaway:** If three enemies are hitting Eden in one round, his concentration is probably gone. Solution: better positioning, use cover, have allies protect.

### Magic Missile as Concentration Breaker

**The Question:** "Does targeting multiple Magic Missiles on the same caster work the way I think it does for concentration?"

**Tormund's Answer:** YES. Each dart forces a separate CON save.

**Mechanics:**
- Magic Missile at 1st level = 3 darts
- Each dart hits automatically
- Each dart = separate source of damage
- Therefore: **3 concentration saves**, not one
- DC 10 for each (damage too low to raise DC)

**Demonstration:**
- Eden cast Magic Missile at Tormund (rolled 3, 4, 1 = 8 damage)
- Tormund concentrating on Mage Armor
- Three saves: Pass, Pass, **Fail**
- Mage Armor dropped

**Tormund (delighted):**
*"That's why experienced casters fear Magic Missile more than bigger damage spells. Fireball is one save. Magic Missile is three, four, or five saves depending on slot level."*

**Defense Against Magic Missile:**
- Higher CON modifier
- War Caster feat (advantage on concentration saves) - higher level
- Resilient (Constitution) feat - higher level
- **What Eden can do NOW:** Don't get hit. Positioning. Cover. Stay behind allies.

### Eden's Realization

*"I've also learned that shooting at your teacher is considered valid pedagogy in magic school."*

**Tormund:** *"Welcome to combat magic education. We don't use training dummies - they don't cast Shield or make concentration saves."*

---

## The Vane Meeting

**Location:** Rose Garden tavern, merchant quarter. Private room upstairs. Neutral ground.

**Vane's Opening:**
She cut straight to it: *"You're here to decline formal partnership while proposing continued informal coordination. Yes?"*

She already knew. Kitchen gossip travels fast. She'd extrapolated.

**Her Response (before Eden even gave his prepared speech):**
*"Yes. The Rookery accepts informal coordination. We prefer it, actually. Partners who maintain independence are more valuable than assets we control."*

Then: *"Now. Say what you came to say anyway. I want to hear how you framed it."*

Testing not the decision (already accepted), but Eden's reasoning and boundaries.

### Eden's First Move

Didn't give his prepared speech. Asked a clarifying question instead:

*"Surely I'm not more valuable than you. Unless you're also an independent partner."*

**Vane's Reaction:** Laughed. Genuine delight.

*"Oh, that's good. You didn't answer my request. You asked a clarifying question about power structures instead."*

### Vane's Structure Explanation

**The Rookery:**
- Not a hierarchy - a network
- "Quills" = decision-makers in specific domains (~6 total)
- Vane = Quill for palace operations and noble-house intelligence
- Quills coordinate with each other but don't command
- No formal leadership, no ownership
- People with capabilities who coordinate when interests align

**Vane's Status:**
*"I'm an independent partner. 'Quill-level' means I make decisions for the Rookery in specific domains, but I'm not owned by them. Very similar to what you're building, actually."*

**The Pattern:**
Multiple networks, no ownership. Becoming a node. Like Vane.

### The Blackwater Contract

**Eden:** *"I have pre-existing commitments. Obviously, to the Crown, but I also have a contract with a certain merchant 'Blackwater' which guarantees exclusivity to non-Crown intelligence."*

Smart move - flagging potential conflict upfront.

**Vane's Response:**
Blackwater and Rookery aren't competitors. Different spaces (merchant/economic vs political/infiltration). Mostly complementary with some overlap.

*"When you say 'word just gets out sometimes' because operatives work together... That's exactly how networks function. Information flows through natural coordination."*

She described exactly what's happening with "Sergeant Valdis" on the protection detail.

**The Arrangement:**
*"Natural information flow through operational proximity rather than formal intelligence sharing."*

### Eden's Closing

*"I'd like to avoid unpleasant audits of paper trails in any case. Really just dreadful paperwork. Let's just let what happens, happen."*

**Vane (laughing):** *"Gods, you sound like your father."*

Toast: *"To information finding its natural paths and avoiding dreadful paperwork."*

### The Final Revelation

Before shaking hands, Vane had one more thing:

**Kethris Coordination:**
- Rookery has been Kethris's primary intelligence conduit for 6 years
- They brokered her initial contact with Aldrin
- They've facilitated most of her Crown-adjacent operations

**The Truth:**
*"You were built for this, Eden. Not just by your father. By all of us. Kethris, the Rookery, Miriam, your mentors. We've been coordinating your development since Thornhaven."*

**Eden's Response:**
*"Today has been about accepting who I am. So informal coordination it is."*

Shook hands. Deal made.

**Vane's Parting Gift:**
Confirmed Private Rendered is legitimate. Palace guard, six years service, exactly what she claims. Surname genuinely coincidental. Vane checked because she knew Eden would be paranoid.

---

## Visiting Kethris

**Location:** Temple of Helm, private healing ward, third floor eastern wing.

**Lyren's Assessment (at door):**
*"She's... better. Temple healers say another week minimum before she's mobile. The binding marks are healing but the necrotic corruption went deep. She's lucid. Sharp. But she gets tired fast. And she has nightmares."*

Protective daughter energy. Would end the visit if Kethris looked too tired.

### The Conversation

**Kethris's Appearance:**
Exactly as Vane warned. Gaunt. Gray. Binding marks bandaged but visible edges still angry red. Three days of torture evident in every line of her face.

But her eyes: sharp. Amber-brown. Intelligent. Assessing.

**Her Opening:**
*"You look tired. But whole. Good. I told Whisper you'd pull it off. He doubted. I didn't."*

**Eden's Response:**
*"I couldn't have done it without him. I'd have been going in blind."*

**Kethris (pleased):** *"Good answer. Credit where it's due."*

### The Warning About Vorthanis

*"Vorthanis is coming for you. You know that."*

"I know."

*"Good. Fear keeps you alive. But so does preparation."*

**Vorthanis's Pattern:**
When hunting someone personally, he doesn't come directly. He **positions first**.
- Gathers information
- Finds leverage  
- Goes after people AROUND the target before the target
- Your father, mentors, allies

*"He did it to me. Spent two years positioning before he grabbed me. I knew it was coming and couldn't stop it."*

**Her Advice:**
*"Don't let him isolate you. Keep your network strong. That's how you survive him."*

### The Critical Question

**Eden:** *"The network of people who value me, or the network of people who care about me?"*

**Kethris (laughing, then wincing):** *"That's exactly the right question."*

**Her Answer:** Both. But if you can only have one, choose the people who value you.

**The Distinction:**
- **Care is vulnerable:** Can be leveraged, threatened, used as hostages. Vorthanis is excellent at that.
- **Value is resilient:** People who benefit from your capabilities, who need what you provide. Harder to corrupt or turn. They protect you because it's in their interest.

*"Your father cares about you. That's a weakness Vorthanis will exploit. But Brecht values you. Tormund values you. The Rookery values you. I value you. Those relationships are harder to weaponize because they're not purely emotional. They're strategic."*

**Quote:**
*"Love is beautiful. But in our work, professional respect keeps you alive longer."*

### Hero vs. Operator

**Eden:** *"Then I have respect in spades. I'm the Hero of Thornhaven."*

**Kethris (warning):**
*"Yes. You are. But don't let that become your identity. Heroes are predictable. Heroes have patterns. Heroes can be manipulated through their heroism."*

*"Vorthanis doesn't fear heroes. He's killed dozens. What he fears is operators - people who are effective, adaptable, and don't need glory."*

**The Real Identity:**
*"The Hero of Thornhaven is a title. A story. It's useful for reputation. But Eden Sagebough, the information broker who coordinates networks and solves problems nobody else can see? That's the person Vorthanis actually has to worry about."*

Then she started fading. Exhausted. Lyren ended the visit.

**Kethris's Final Words:**
*"Thank you. For getting me out. For not leaving me there. When I'm recovered, we'll talk properly. About coordination. About the other reformist exarchs. About what comes next."*

## The Augury Innovation

**Evening, Back at Quarters:**

Eden had a realization while trying to figure out how to probe the unknown watcher's intentions without being able to act on them directly.

**The Problem:**
Augury requires an action Eden will take in the next 30 minutes. Can't ask hypotheticals. Can't predict distant future events.

**The Innovation:**
Use Augury to simulate someone else's knowledge state as a proxy for information Eden can't access directly.

**The Technique (Knights-and-Knaves Logic):**
Treat the Weave like a logic puzzle. Force it to compute/simulate Brecht's knowledge as a proxy for the underlying reality Eden can't query directly.

### The Framework

**Question 1:**
*"If I ask Brecht to list individuals or groups who might respond to the ward message, will he list the unknown one?"*

**Possible Results:**
- Weal = Yes, he'll list them (they're on Crown's radar)
- Woe = No, he won't (completely off intelligence map)
- Both = Multiple possibilities, uncertainty
- Nothing = Question too vague

**Conditional Follow-ups (prepared based on result):**

**On Weal:** "If asked for a shorter list of harm-motivated and immediately dangerous individuals or groups, will he also list it?"

**On Woe:** "If I asked him who might know, will he list someone who actually does?"

**On Weal/Woe:** "Will our conversation result in a narrowing of his certainty to three candidates or less?"

**On Nothing:** No follow-up (question was unpredictable)

### The Casts

**First Augury Result: WEAL AND WOE**

Brecht WILL list possibilities, but it won't be clear which one is the unknown watcher. Multiple candidates. Signal mixed with noise.

**Second Augury (revised for specificity):**
*"Will our conversation result in a narrowing of his certainty to three candidates or less?"*

**Result: WOE**

No. The conversation won't narrow it that far. Brecht will have more than three plausible candidates even after discussion.

### The Temporal Paradox

Eden noticed: He used Augury to predict a conversation, and now the Augury result will change how he conducts that conversation, which means the prediction influenced its own outcome.

**Eden's Thought:**
*"The omen decides the conversation, and the conversation decides the omen. Probably shouldn't think about that too hard."*

Fang: *You're thinking too hard.*

**The Solution:** Don't untangle causality loops. Just accept the Weave showed the most likely outcome. Use the information practically.

**Eden's Later Reaction (to himself):**
*"Oh, Tormund is going to LOVE this."*

---

## Briefing Brecht

**Late Evening, Brecht's Office**

Eden went to brief Brecht immediately (giving him overnight to process).

### Opening Move: Total Transparency

**Eden:** *"I'm going to be totally transparent with you. If you felt anything weird in the past fifteen minutes or so, it's because I was poking around in your brain with these."*

Produced Augury sticks with emphasis.

**Brecht's Reaction:**
Stared. Then: *"You used Augury to predict what I would say in a conversation we haven't had yet?"*

"Yes."

*"That's... either brilliant or deeply concerning. Possibly both."*

Not offended. Just professionally curious about being the subject of oracular interrogation.

### The Information Exchange

**What Eden Learned via Augury:**
1. Brecht has answers - multiple possibilities for who the unknown watcher could be
2. Even after discussion, won't narrow to three or fewer candidates
3. Either too many plausible suspects or intelligence too fragmentary

**Brecht's File:**
Seventeen possibilities. Some more likely than others. Can't eliminate enough for clean short list.

Unknown signature characteristics:
- Sophisticated, unfamiliar
- Started appearing exactly when Eden became operationally visible (2 weeks ago)
- Weekly monitoring pattern

**Information Distribution:**
Only four people know about the unknown signature:
1. Brecht
2. The King (general terms)
3. Aldrin
4. Tormund (consulted for magical signature analysis)

Limited distribution - didn't want to alert watcher that they're aware.

### The Ward Message Revelation

**Eden:** *"My father and I left a message in the wards for this unknown party. Just a professional acknowledgement and invitation to collaboration on... whatever they're looking for."*

**Brecht (very still):** *"You baited them. Directly."*

**Eden:** *"Acknowledged them. And offered coordination if they're willing to identify their interests."*

### Crown Involvement Decision

**Eden's Logic:**
*"Since they're breaching wards on Palace property, I'm inclined to involve the King. Better to have a tenable official posture for each of your - what - seventeen candidates, than to be caught with your pants all the way down."*

**Brecht (immediately agreeing):**
Palace security is Crown jurisdiction. He'll brief the King tomorrow morning.

**The Protocol:**
- Brief King in general terms
- Prepare diplomatic protocols for likely candidates
- When unknown party responds, Eden informs Brecht immediately
- Assess stated interests, match against candidates
- Determine appropriate Crown response
- Eden coordinates actual contact (initiated it) with Crown authority backing

**Brecht's Point:**
*"Your father's been operating in grey areas for twenty years. You don't have to. You have official position and resources. Use them. That's why we gave you the title."*

**Eden:** *"I'm sure that will be to his relief."*

---

## End of Day 9

Eden returned to quarters. Actual rest. Mission accomplished:

**Day's Achievements:**
- Father-son relationship deepened (breakfast, ward work, hug)
- Surveillance ward modified to contact unknown watcher
- Concentration training completed (learned limits)
- Magic Missile mechanics understood
- Vane meeting successful (informal coordination established)
- Kethris visited (warning received, respect earned)
- Augury innovation developed (proxy knowledge queries)
- Brecht briefed (Crown backing secured)

**Portent Dice Status:**
18 and 20 - **NEVER USED**. Entire day with two incredibly powerful options available. Perfect discipline maintained.

**Sleep:**
Came easier. Not because threats are gone (Vorthanis still reforming), but because Eden has networks, resources, people watching his back.

Not just surviving. Building infrastructure.

---

## Key Events

1. **First real Portent roll** - 18 and 20, held discipline all day
2. **Breakfast with father** - peaceful moment, relationship deepened
3. **Ward modification** - message to unknown watcher established
4. **Surveillance records reviewed** - Vorthanis knew about Aldrin for 13+ years
5. **Mother's journal offered** - confirmation preparation was done with love
6. **The hug** - father-son moment of acceptance
7. **Flaming Sphere training** - learned concentration limits (two saves threshold)
8. **Magic Missile lesson** - each dart = separate concentration save
9. **Vane meeting** - informal coordination accepted, network status acknowledged
10. **Kethris visit** - warning about Vorthanis's positioning tactics
11. **Augury innovation** - proxy knowledge queries via predicted conversations
12. **Brecht briefing** - Crown backing secured for unknown watcher contact

---

## Character Development

### Eden's Evolution

**Identity Acceptance:**
Day 9's theme: accepting who he is. Built by father, Rookery, Kethris, mentors over months/years. Not fighting it anymore. Claiming agency within that reality.

**Quote:** *"Today has been about accepting who I am."*

**Network Understanding:**
From individual operator to network node. Multiple connections: Crown, Rookery, Kethris faction, Blackwater, mentors. Value comes from being neutral enough to work with anyone, committed enough to care about outcomes.

**Discipline Demonstration:**
Portent dice (18, 20) available all day. Never used. Followed rubric perfectly despite temptation. That's the real test - not casting the spell, but having the power and choosing when NOT to use it.

**Innovation:**
Developed "knights-and-knaves" Augury technique - using divination to simulate others' knowledge states as proxy for inaccessible information. Tormund will love/hate this.

**Professional Maturity:**
- Transparent with Brecht about using Augury on him
- Recognized need for Crown backing on unknown watcher
- Understood care vs. value distinction in relationships
- Chose infrastructure over heroism

### Key Insights Gained

**From Kethris:**
*"Love is beautiful. But in our work, professional respect keeps you alive longer."*

Care can be weaponized. Value is more resilient.

**From Vane:**
*"You were built for this, Eden. Not just by your father. By all of us."*

The preparation wasn't solo manipulation - it was coordinated development across multiple networks.

**From Aldrin:**
*"Resources unused feel wasted. Resources misused are actually wasted."*

The best insurance is the policy you never file a claim on.

**From Himself:**
*"The omen decides the conversation, and the conversation decides the omen."*

Divination creates temporal loops. Don't think too hard about it. Just use the information.

---

## Relationships

### Deepened

**Aldrin (Father):**
- Breakfast together (peaceful, not rushed)
- Collaborative ward work (literal magical partnership)
- Journal offered (mother's perspective on preparation)
- The hug (acceptance and love)
- Promise made: "When that time comes, I'll find you" (processing compartmentalized emotions eventually)

**Brecht (Crown Handler):**
- Total transparency about Augury use
- Professional respect for innovation
- Crown backing secured
- Trust deepened (he'll brief King based on Eden's assessment)

**Tormund (Mentor):**
- Practical training (concentration limits, Magic Missile mechanics)
- Let Eden shoot him with magic (valid pedagogy)
- Would love/hate the Augury innovation when he learns about it

**Kethris (Reformist Exarch):**
- First real conversation post-rescue
- Warning about Vorthanis given
- Respect earned ("you're exactly the person Vorthanis has to worry about")
- Future coordination promised when recovered

- Informal coordination formalized (paradoxically)
- Mutual recognition as independent nodes
- Natural information flow established
- Professional courtesy between operators

### Established

**Whisper (Kethris's Familiar):**
- Named relationship from Session 10
- Continued partnership acknowledged
- Will coordinate future Kethris meetings

**Lyren (Kethris's Daughter):**
- Protective of mother
- Grateful for extraction plan that let her help
- Will be part of future coordination

**Marta (Night Kitchen Head):**
- Information network hub
- Trusts Eden with gossip
- Provides practical support (food, coordination)

**Protection Detail:**
- Thorne: Professional respect, watching for Portent addiction
- Rendered: Legitimacy confirmed, surname coincidental
- Both: Agreed to watch Eden's judgment, not just his safety

---

## Themes Explored

### Accepting Identity

Day 9's core theme: Eden accepting he was "built" by multiple networks over time, and claiming agency within that reality rather than resenting or denying it.

**Quote:** *"Today has been about accepting who I am."*

Not fighting the manipulation. Not pretending to be purely self-made. Just acknowledging the inputs and taking ownership of outputs.

### Care vs. Value

Kethris's distinction: People who care can be weaponized (hostages, leverage, pressure). People who value you protect you because it's strategically sound.

**The Paradox:** You still need both. But if forced to choose in operational context, value is more resilient than care.

**Application:** Eden's network is increasingly built on professional respect rather than purely emotional bonds.

### Infrastructure Over Heroism

**Kethris's Warning:**
Heroes are predictable. Heroes have patterns. Heroes need glory. Operators are effective, adaptable, and don't need recognition.

**Eden's Reality:**
"Hero of Thornhaven" is a useful title. Eden Sagebough the information broker is the actual threat.

Building infrastructure (procedures, networks, capability) that outlasts individual operations.

### The Discipline of Power

Portent: 18 and 20 available all day. Never used.

Not because there weren't opportunities. Because none met the rubric:
1. Someone will die
2. Mission fails catastrophically

The temptation was constant. The discipline held.

**Aldrin's Wisdom:** "The best insurance is the policy you never file a claim on."

### Information as Leverage

Multiple threads demonstrating how information flows create power:
- Augury as proxy for inaccessible knowledge
- Surveillance records as historical intelligence
- Natural information flow through operational proximity
- "Information in the right hands" as operating philosophy

Not controlling information. Facilitating its flow to people who can act on it.

### Temporal Loops and Divination

Eden discovering that using Augury to predict a conversation changes how he conducts that conversation, which means the prediction influenced its own outcome.

**The Solution:** Don't untangle it. Accept the Weave shows most likely outcome. Use the information practically. Let causality sort itself out.

This is how diviners either go mad or become pragmatic. Eden chose pragmatic.

---

## Magic & Mechanics

### Portent (Level 3 Divination Feature)

**Day 9 Roll:** 18 and 20

**Usage:** NONE. Entire day, never spent.

**Discipline:** Followed Tormund's rubric perfectly despite constant temptation.

**Reset:** Dawn Day 10 (will roll new portents)

### Concentration Training Results

**Findings:**
- Single hit: maintains easily
- Two rapid hits: can hold through both saves
- Three rapid hits: concentration breaks (that's the limit)

**Tactical Implication:** If three enemies hitting in one round, concentration spell probably drops. Need better positioning or allies protecting.

### Magic Missile Mechanics

**Discovery:** Each dart = separate source of damage = separate CON save

**At 1st Level:** 3 darts = 3 saves (all DC 10)

**Effectiveness:** Not about damage. About forcing multiple saves. Even high-CON casters can fail one of three DC 10 saves.

**Demonstration:** Eden's Magic Missile (8 damage) broke Tormund's concentration (passed 2, failed 3rd)

### Augury Innovation - Proxy Knowledge Queries

**Technique:** Use Augury to simulate/predict someone else's knowledge state as proxy for information you can't access directly.

**Example:**
Can't ask: "What are unknown watcher's intentions?" (no action, too vague)
CAN ask: "If I ask Brecht to list possible watchers, will he list this one?" (action, binary outcome, tests Brecht's knowledge as proxy for underlying reality)

**Structure:** Knights-and-knaves logic. Treat Weave like logic puzzle. Force it to compute NPC knowledge states.

**Legitimacy:** 
- ✅ Mechanically valid (real actions, immediate timeframe, binary outcomes)
- ✅ In-character (information architecture thinking)
- ✅ Creative problem-solving within constraints
- ⚠️ Tormund will have STRONG OPINIONS

**Limitations:**
- Only works for people Eden can actually talk to
- They must actually know something
- 30-minute window still applies
- Temporal paradox: prediction influences conversation which influences outcome

### Spell Slots Usage

**Started Day 9 With:**
- 2 second-level slots
- 4 first-level slots

**Used:**
- 2 second-level (both Flaming Sphere practice)
- 1 first-level (Magic Missile at Tormund)
- 2 Augury rituals (no slot cost)

**Ending Day 9:**

## Memorable Moments

1. **Portent roll** - 18 and 20, immediate temptation, immediate discipline

3. **Ward modification** - father-son magical collaboration, literal partnership
4. **Mother's journal** - learning she knew and understood what Aldrin was doing
5. **The hug** - "Thank you, Dad" → twenty years of complexity in one moment
6. **Shooting Tormund** - "I've also learned that shooting at your teacher is valid pedagogy"
7. **Tormund's laugh** - "Welcome to combat magic education"
8. **Magic Missile demonstration** - three saves, failed third, Mage Armor dropped

## Quotes

**On Portent Power:**
*"Resources unused feel wasted. Resources misused are actually wasted."* - Aldrin

*"The best insurance is the policy you never file a claim on."* - Aldrin (quoting Eden's mother)

**On Identity:**
*"Today has been about accepting who I am."* - Eden

*"You were built for this, Eden. Not just by your father. By all of us."* - Vane

**On Networks:**
*"Partners who maintain independence are more valuable than assets they control."* - Vane (and Aldrin, and Kethris - it's a shared philosophy)

**On Relationships:**
*"Love is beautiful. But in our work, professional respect keeps you alive longer."* - Kethris

*"People who care about you can be leveraged. People who value you protect you because it's in their interest."* - Kethris

**On Heroism:**
*"Vorthanis doesn't fear heroes. He's killed dozens. What he fears is operators."* - Kethris

*"The Hero of Thornhaven is a title. Eden Sagebough, the information broker? That's the person Vorthanis has to worry about."* - Kethris

**On Divination:**
*"Sometimes you just show up and see what happens."* - Tormund (advice Eden promptly ignored by preparing for two hours)

*"The omen decides the conversation, and the conversation decides the omen. Probably shouldn't think about that too hard."* - Eden (on temporal paradox)

**On Pedagogy:**
*"I've also learned that shooting at your teacher is considered valid pedagogy in magic school."* - Eden

*"Welcome to combat magic education. We don't use training dummies - they don't cast Shield or make concentration saves."* - Tormund

**On Information:**

*"To information finding its natural paths and avoiding dreadful paperwork."* - Vane (toast)

**On Transparency:**
*"I'm going to be totally transparent with you. If you felt anything weird in the past fifteen minutes, it's because I was poking around in your brain with these."* - Eden (showing Augury sticks to Brecht)

**On Resources:**
*"Your father's been operating in grey areas for twenty years. You don't have to. You have official position and resources. Use them. That's why we gave you the title."* - Brecht

## Next Session Preview

**Day 10 - Return to Active Duty**

Morning brings:
- New Portent roll (reset from Day 9's unused 18/20)
- King's briefing on unknown watcher situation
- Formal authorization for coordination expected by midday
- Return to official operations

Ongoing threads:
- Vorthanis reforming (hours to days, top 3 priority for revenge)
- Unknown watcher will receive ward message (likely within a week)
- Kethris recovering (another week before mobile)
- Protection detail on high alert
- Multiple networks coordinating through Eden

The question:
Can Eden maintain discipline with Portent? Or will Day 10 bring a situation that actually requires those powerful dice?

And somewhere in the Lower Planes, Vorthanis is reconstituting. Learning. Planning.

The positioning has begun.
