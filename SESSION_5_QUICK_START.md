    16	Eden Sagebough (Level 2 Wizard) arrived in Thornhaven and discovered a Bhaal cult attempting to tear the town into the Shadowfell, killing ~300 people. Over three days, he dismantled their three-site ritual operation, captured seven cultists, recovered three grimoires stolen 20 years ago (his father's unsolved case), and outwitted the death god himself six times. Now he's at the capital preparing for a Royal Court audience to present the recovered artifacts and receive recognition.

   115	
   116	Eden wakes in guest room at father's townhouse. Morning sunlight, smell of breakfast. Today is the Royal Court audience. Aldrin calls up: "Eden! Breakfast is ready. Court proceedings can take hours—eat well."

   130	- Court politics
   131	- Elara's trial (justice vs. mercy)

   160	- Apocalypse prevented
   161	- Divine conspiracy exposed
