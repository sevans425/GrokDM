   130	## DM Notes for Session 7
   131	- Balance action (cultist confrontation) with continued education/development
   132	- Show effects of sleep deprivation on cultists (mistakes, irritability, degraded performance)
   133	- Decoy operation provides multiple narrative opportunities
   134	- Eden's divination interest creates new magical capabilities to explore
   135	- Protection detail becomes part of daily life (constraint + security)
   136	- Consider: Does a cultist strike at a decoy? Real Eden? Do they realize it's a trap?
