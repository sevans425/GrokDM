    54	## Key Takeaways from Session 6
    55	
    56	1. **Character Evolution**: Eden transitioned from reactive hero to proactive orchestrator
    57	2. **System Building**: Established multiple support networks (intelligence, protection, education)
    58	3. **Magical Foundation**: Completed first three chapters of Principia Arcana, identified specialization path
    59	4. **Tactical Planning**: Designed multi-layered trap using decoys and sleep deprivation
    60	5. **No Combat**: Entirely social/intellectual session—successful pacing variation
    61	
    62	## Rate Limit Strategy
    63	
    64	Session 6 wrap-up used **one-at-a-time checkpoint writing** to avoid API rate limits:
    65	1. Pre-update checkpoint written
    66	2. Worker called for spreadsheet formatting
    67	3. Post-update checkpoint written
    68	4. Summary checkpoint written
    69	5. Complete checkpoint written
    70	6. Quick start guide for Session 7 written
    71	
    72	This approach successfully prevented rate limit issues even with extensive session documentation.

    99	*"I'm building a chokepoint around my lack of confidence. They need me, and the less they can think, the less creative they can be about circumventing our plans, the less critical they can be about the decoys. They're on a divine time limit. They'll walk into the trap eventually, but it won't be me trapping them—it'll be a host of others. I'm just the target."*
