     6	**The Road to the Capital**
     7	
     8	Session 4 opened with Eden, Rorick, and Miriam preparing to depart Thornhaven at dawn with the recovered grimoires, dangerous artifacts, and seven prisoners. The mission: deliver everything safely to the capital for Royal Court justice.
     9	
    10	Eden proposed a brilliant tactical split: send the obvious prisoner wagon down the well-traveled main road as a decoy, while a small, fast group took the lockbox via the less-predictable trader's road. To further enhance security, Eden sent his lockbox key with Sergeant Brickle's prisoner group via Miriam's crow Fetch, ensuring no single party could access the contents even if captured.
    11	
    12	The journey began smoothly, but at a creek crossing, Eden's familiar Fang discovered a cultist staging ground. Six riders had camped there, waiting. They'd murdered a merchant from Millford to gather intelligence, then split their forces: three rode south toward the prisoner wagon, three continued north on the trader's road—directly ahead of Eden's group.
    13	
    14	Eden made the call: push forward with maximum speed and maximum reconnaissance. Using Fang on the ground, Miriam's crow Thought in the trees, and crow Memory high above, they created layered scouting coverage that detected the ambush before walking into it. Three cultists lay in wait, weapons ready, watching the road.
    15	
    16	Eden's solution? Don't engage at all. The party led their horses quietly through the forest, bypassing the ambush position entirely. The cultists never knew they'd passed. Victory number six against Bhaal: won without a single blow struck, purely through superior intelligence and tactical patience.
    17	
    18	The group rode through the night with minimal rest, sustained by Miriam's stimulant tea. A brief stop at The Wayward Mule Inn in Millford, then the final push. As they approached the capital, the landscape transformed—more patrols, more traffic, civilized safety. The cultists' window of opportunity had closed.
    19	
    20	Arriving at the capital's massive gates, Eden immediately requested escort to City Guard Headquarters. Captain Thorne, a steel-eyed veteran, listened to their initial report with skepticism—until Rorick opened the lockbox halfway with his single key, revealing the faint magical glow of ancient grimoires within.
    21	
    22	Thorne rang for officials. Within minutes, Lieutenant Harrow, Scribe Davos, Magistrate Kellan, and Priestess Lyra assembled. And then, summoned urgently, Aldrin Sagebough—Master Archivist and Eden's father—burst through the door.
    23	
    24	The reunion was electric. Twenty years of obsessive investigation, and his son had solved it in three days. When Aldrin peered into the lockbox and recognized the archival markings on the grimoires' spines, he wept openly.
    25	
    26	Eden provided comprehensive formal testimony, documented by Scribe Davos for the Royal Court. He recounted every detail: the Thornhaven disappearances, the shadow creatures, the three ritual sites, the cultist captures, Elara's possession and cooperation, the grimoire recovery, the deception of Bhaal, the wilderness opening strategy, the false necromancer trail, and finally the journey to the capital with its ambush and evasion.
    27	
    28	The officials sat in stunned silence. Captain Thorne, who'd been ready to dismiss them as frauds, instead thanked Eden for his service to the kingdom. Magistrate Kellan arranged an audience with the King for the following day. Priestess Lyra confirmed the theological mechanics were sound—Bhaal's connection had been severed when the planar barriers were re-warded.
    29	
    30	That evening, Aldrin brought Eden home to his townhouse—three stories of books, maps, and twenty years of case files. Over simple food, father and son talked. Aldrin admitted his shame that it took his son to finish what he'd started. Eden insisted it was collaboration—twenty years of foundation work allowing for three days of execution.
    31	
    32	In Aldrin's study, an entire wall was dedicated to the 1284 case. Three empty rectangles marked where the grimoires should be, outlined in red ink like wounds. "Twenty years," Aldrin whispered. "And now, because of you, I can finally stop."
    33	
    34	Eden slept that night in his father's guest room—truly safe for the first time in days. Fang curled up beside him. Tomorrow would bring the Royal Court, formal recognition, and whatever comes next.
    35	
    36	But tonight, he was just a son in his father's house, having solved the mystery that defined his entire childhood.

   102	- Testimony about prevented apocalypse (300 lives saved)
   103	- Potential rewards from Crown (titles, positions, gold, magical items?)
   104	- Father standing beside him as Master Archivist
   105	- Formal closure of 1284 theft case

   117	
   118	### Immediate Context for Session 5:
   119	Eden wakes in his father's townhouse, well-rested and prepared. Today he stands before the King of Aldoria to present the most significant case resolution in twenty years. His father will accompany him, finally able to close the book on the mystery that consumed his entire career.
   120	
   121	The grimoires that vanished two decades ago will be formally recovered. The cult that nearly destroyed Thornhaven will face royal justice. And a second-level wizard who arrived in a small town four days ago will be recognized as the hero who prevented an apocalypse.
   122	
   123	But three cultists remain at large, and Bhaal's long memory means the death god won't forget the young elf who embarrassed him six times. Victory today, but vigilance tomorrow.
