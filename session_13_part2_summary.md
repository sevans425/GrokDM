## Session Recap

After the emotional chaos of Day 12 (first confessions, fetal positions, family dinner), Days 13-14 brought relationship development, parallel parent romance, competitive board games with divine intervention, first kisses, tactical relationship protocols, a delightful city outing, and preparation for Eden's first solo operation.

Also: Eden accidentally mentioned marriage after dating for two days and will never live it down.

---

## Day 13 - Morning: The Board Game Incident

**Portent Roll: 11 and 3**

Decent and potentially problematic. Perfect for competitive sabotage.

### The Aldrin Revelation

Before meeting Lyren, Eden visited his father at the Archives.

**Aldrin's News:**

Kethris had visited him the previous night. They talked about:
- Their children being disasters
- Both disappearing into work to avoid isolation
- How they've both raised competent but emotionally incompetent kids

**The Invitation:**

Kethris suggested tea. Weekly. As two people, not as Royal Archivist and Exarch.

Aldrin accepted.

**Their first tea: That very afternoon.**

**Eden's Reaction:**

*"HO. LY. CRAP. NO WAY. Lyren is going to DIE. But I'm happy for you! Go get her!"*

Full support. Delight at the irony. Both Sagebough men being pursued by assertive women from the same family.

### Meeting Lyren - Processing Parent Dating

Both arrived at the conservatory with VERY complicated expressions.

Simultaneous realization: "So my dad/mom—"

**Lyren's Response:**

*"My mother. Having TEA. With your FATHER. This is INSANE."*

**Eden's Response:**

*"It's PERFECT. We're both disasters and now our parents are ALSO disasters. It's like poetry. It rhymes."*

**Agreement:**

They would NOT spy on the parent tea date (giving them space, being mature).

But they WOULD compare notes afterward.

### Dragon's Hoard - The Most Intense Board Game Ever

**The Setup:**

Territory control game. Dice-based resource gathering. First to 100 gold wins.

Stakes: Pure competition and emotional processing of parent-dating revelation.

**Lyren's Trash Talk:**

*"I will question every Portent usage. And I will make you regret being able to see the future."*

**The Strategic Portent Usage:**

Eden saved both Portents (11 and 3) for maximum impact rather than using on initiative.

**The Game:**

Extremely close. Lead trading back and forth.

**Turn 12:** Lyren 47, Eden 44
**Turn 15:** Lyren 68, Eden 65

**The Portent Burn (Turn ~18):**

Eden rolled a 2. Used Portent 11 to turn it into 11 gold.

Lyren: *"You just CHANGED REALITY to get 11 gold. That's CHEATING!"*

Eden: *"That's DIVINATION MAGIC!"*

Put Eden at 76, ahead for first time in several turns.

**The Final Stretch:**

Both players in the 90s. Racing to 100.

**Eden's Hot Streak:**

Rolled THREE NATURAL SIXES in the final turns (97 → 91 → 97 → 103).

**Lyren's Nat 1:**

At 97 gold (one away from certain victory next turn), rolled Natural 1. Only got to 98.

**Eden's Sabotage:**

When Lyren rolled 5 (would put her at 99, one from winning), Eden used Portent 3 to turn it into a 3.

*"WHAT?! You just SABOTAGED me with DIVINE MAGIC!"*

Tied at 97-97.

**Lyren's Despair Roll:**

Rolled Natural 1 again. At 98, one from winning.

**Eden's Game Winner:**

Needed 3+ to win. Rolled NATURAL 6.

**Final Score: Eden 103, Lyren 98**

Won on pure dice luck after strategic Portent usage.

### Post-Game Closeness

**Lyren's Approach:**

Walked around table. Stood close. "You know what this means, right?"

Not touching-close at first. But closer than "just friends playing board games."

**The Question:**

*"What does it mean?"*

**Lyren's Deflection (and Truth):**

*"It means I get revenge. Best two out of three."*

But: *"It also means you're extremely annoying and I had way too much fun losing to you."*

**The Actual Conversation:**

Lyren: *"We successfully avoided talking about feelings for an entire board game. That's healthy coping, right?"*

She gave Eden an out. Could laugh it off. Set up another game.

Or be honest.

### The First Kiss

**Eden's Honesty:**

*"I'm feeling one thing and thinking another. And the tension makes me want to spiral. But I won't. Because I want to... stay close."*

**Lyren's Response:**

*"Yeah. Me too. The feeling part is good. The thinking part is 'what if I mess it up.' But staying close sounds nice."*

**The Awkward Discussion:**

Neither knowing what to do next. Both admitting they're disasters at this.

**Lyren's Step Forward:**

Took Eden's hand. Just held it.

*"Is this okay?"*

**Eden's Tug:**

Just a little. She stepped closer.

**The Moment:**

Lyren's hand on his shoulder. His hand holding hers. Both nervous. Both hopeful.

**Eden's Move:**

*"Oh, shut your mouth."*

Leaned in the rest of the way.

**The Kiss:**

Awkward at first. Noses bumped. But good. Really good.

When they pulled back:

Lyren: *"You just told me to shut my mouth and then kissed me. That's the most confident thing you've done since I met you."*

Eden: *"I have no idea where that came from."*

Lyren: *"Well, do it again."*

So he did.

**Fang's Reaction:**

Turned completely around. Facing away. *This is mortifying for a familiar.*

---

## The Parent Tea Date (Interlude)

**Aldrin's Preparation:**

Pacing. Changed clothes three times. Made tea, second-guessed it, made different tea.

Complete disaster. Just like his son.

**Kethris's Arrival:**

Both being SO formal. Painful politeness.

Talking about TEA QUALITY for way too long.

**The Breakthrough:**

Kethris: *"This is ridiculous. We're acting like we've never had a conversation."*

**The Actual Conversation:**

Kethris challenged Aldrin: *"What's the least dry scholarly book you've read in the past week?"*

Aldrin couldn't remember the last non-scholarly thing he read. Twenty years since his wife made him read fiction.

**Kethris's Assignment:**

She's giving him reading homework. Something entertaining. Making him remember books can be enjoyed, not just studied.

**Aldrin's Passion:**

Started talking about treaty language evolution patterns. Animated. Excited.

Kethris genuinely interested. Engaging. Asking questions.

**The Realization:**

Kethris: *"You light up when you talk about things you care about. It's nice to see."*

Aldrin: *"That's flattering in a way I'd forgotten how to process."*

His wife used to tell him that. Kethris was reminding him he used to be a person.

**The Agreement:**

Tea once a week. Minimum. Not allowed to only talk about work.

**Topics:** Books they enjoy. Things that excite them. Their disastrous children. Normal person things.

**The Moment:**

Kethris suggesting they both need someone to remind them to stop disappearing into work.

Aldrin realizing he's been disappearing for twenty years. Nobody to stop him.

Until now.

**The Invitation Extended:**

Same time next week. Mandatory humanity time.

Kethris leaving: *"Don't disappear into work tonight. Get some sleep."*

Aldrin sitting with his tea. Smiling.

---

## The Double Date Dinner

**The Setup:**

Kethris's idea. Private dining room. All four of them.

**Seating:**
- Aldrin and Kethris on one side
- Eden and Lyren on the other
- Fang on the table between (because of course)

**The Awkwardness:**

SO MUCH SILENCE. So much formality. Nobody making eye contact.

Someone tried talking about WEATHER.

**The Ice Breaker:**

Eden, in sing-song voice: *"I beat Lyren at Dragon's Hoard! I beat Lyren at Dragon's Hoard!"*

Stuck out tongue like a schoolyard bully.

**The Argument:**

Lyren: *"You rolled THREE NATURAL SIXES!"*

Eden: *"Still counts!"*

Threw dinner rolls at each other. Everyone relaxed.

**The Reveal:**

Kethris asked about their afternoon activities.

Eden and Lyren exchange looks. Both blushing.

**Eden's Brutal Honesty:**

*"We... made out for a while. And cuddled. It was nice in a way that doesn't make finding words easy."*

**Dead Silence.**

Then Kethris laughing: *"The directness. Just stating it plainly."*

Aldrin with head in hands: *"My disaster son."*

**First Kiss Confirmation:**

Kethris: *"First kiss? Oh, honey, that's sweet!"*

Lyren: *"MOM. It's MORTIFYING."*

Both Eden and Aldrin confirmed it was their first kiss.

**Parent Confession:**

Lyren asked about THEIR afternoon.

Aldrin: *"Less of that passion. More conversational. But the connection was something I hadn't felt... in a very long time."*

Kethris: *"For both of us."*

**Weekly Tea Revelation:**

They're doing it weekly. This is happening. Actually happening.

**The Smushed Roll Defense:**

Eden slammed down a roll: *"I dare ANYONE at this table to tell me how I SHOULD have said what I did this afternoon."*

Nobody could. His brutal honesty was actually the most efficient approach.

**The Toast:**

Kethris: *"To first kisses and brutal honesty and our completely disastrous children."*

Aldrin: *"To being slightly less disastrous than our children. Barely."*

Dinner continued. Stories shared. Family-like. Four disasters who found each other.

---

## Day 14 - The City Outing

**Portent Roll: 9 and 14**

Solid, functional. Good for a day meant for enjoying things.

**The Plan:**

All four of them. City market, then gardens. Wherever they end up.

No crisis. No planning. Just being people.

### The Market - Trying to Be Normal

**The Failed Experiment:**

Tried finding things NONE of them found interesting, then making them interesting.

**Pottery:** Kethris immediately analyzed glaze firing temperatures.

**Soap:** Aldrin turned it into research about lavender growing regions.

**Yarn:** All four stared at it. Declared it boring. Failed completely.

**The Better Approach:**

Eden's suggestion: Don't try to be normal OR analytical. Just focus on one thing together. Share observations.

**The Flower Stall - Midnight Violets:**

Kethris gravitated toward them immediately.

**What They Learned:**
- Bloom in low light, avoid sun
- Open at dusk, close at dawn
- Faint bioluminescence for nocturnal pollinators
- Used in sleep potions (mirror natural melatonin)
- Finicky to grow, require specific soil

**Kethris's Passion:**

Revealed she gardens extensively. Has cultivated Midnight Violets for 40 years.

It's how she remembers being mortal. Tending living things. Growth and decay cycles.

**The Philosophical Moment:**

Kethris: *"Books preserve information indefinitely. Plants live, die, regrow. Different kind of permanence."*

Aldrin looking at her with wonder: *"I never thought about it that way."*

**The Invitation:**

Kethris offering to show Aldrin the Temple gardens when Midnight Violets bloom.

Aldrin accepting immediately.

**Eden and Lyren:** Tactfully giving parents space by going to bakery.

### The Bakery - Pastries and Protocols

**Morning Rise Bakery:**

Fresh bread, pastries, confections. Smells incredible.

**Eden's Analysis Paralysis:**

Examining fruit tarts. Berry-to-crust ratio. Glaze distribution.

Lyren: *"EDEN. It's a PASTRY. Not a tactical decision."*

**The Baker's Gift:**

Gave them two cinnamon rolls and three tarts. On the house. "You two are entertaining."

Eden: *"Entertainment value is an unexpected resource."*

**The Bench Discussion:**

Watching parents at flower stall (still deeply engaged in botanical philosophy).

**Lyren's Observation:**

*"Tomorrow you go back to duty. Think we can keep doing this? The not-complicated nice things?"*

**Eden's Promise:**

*"We'll find time."*

### The Gardens - Relationship Protocols

**The Conversation:**

Eden brought up concerns: What does being with him mean? The danger? The command decisions?

**NOT about protecting Lyren.** About establishing mutual understanding.

**Lyren's Response:**

*"I threw myself in front of Malthor's death burst without thinking. I KNOW what it means to care about someone who does dangerous work."*

*"I can handle it. What I CAN'T handle is you pushing me away to 'protect' me."*

**Eden's Clarification:**

Not about protection. About **operational protocols** for the relationship.

Lyren: *"Only YOU would turn 'I care about you' into 'we need contingency plans for mind control.'"*

**The Protocols Established:**

**Capture:**
- Don't trade yourself for the other
- Coordinate with Brecht/Temple for extraction
- Work through proper channels

**Mind Control:**
- If either acting out of character, assume compromise
- Safe word pending (for "not compromised, just being weird")

**Death/Injury:**
- Not at will-writing stage yet (third date territory)
- If unconscious, defer to healers and family
- But consent to experimental treatment if dying

**Operational Security:**
- General info shareable
- Classified Crown intel: no (unless affects reformist safety)
- Exarch politics: share unless Kethris says otherwise

**Communication:**
- Actually TELL each other when dangerous things happen
- Don't hide to protect
- Protocols don't replace communication

**Lyren's Concern:**

*"When you go back to duty and something dangerous happens... I'm allowed to be worried, right?"*

Eden: *"Of course. And I'll tell you. Within operational security constraints."*

### The Kiss (Part 2)

After establishing all protocols:

Lyren: *"No documentation. We remember. We adjust. We TRUST each other."*

Kissed him to stop him from suggesting written protocols.

**Eden's Response:**

*"Oh, now YOU shut MY mouth. Touché."*

Pulled her back in. Kissed her properly.

Comfortable. Happy. Just being together in the gardens.

**The Agreement:**

When asked what was on his mind:

Eden: *"We'll find time."*

For the relationship. For nice things. Between crises and investigations.

**Finding the Parents:**

Aldrin carrying Midnight Violets he'd bought. Both looking happy.

Headed to lunch together. All four of them.

---

## The Café and Afternoon

**(Time-skipped for pacing)**

Lunch at café. They DID analyze the sandwiches. It was delightful.

More walking. More talking. Parents increasingly comfortable.

Lyren holding Eden's hand through most of it.

A perfect day. Last day off before returning to duty.

---

## Evening - The Scrying Sensor Results

**Brecht's Briefing:**

The raven figurine analysis complete.

**The Result:**

**BENIGN.** 

Elderly retired palace mage. Collects puzzle solutions. Places enchanted objects in difficult puzzles for entertainment.

Has been doing this for years. Small community of puzzle enthusiasts.

**What She Saw:**

Eden and Lyren's puzzle box breakdown.

Specifically: *"The young man's eye twitching and subsequent explosion about clockwise rotation."*

Called it *"the most entertaining solve in a decade."*

**Eden's Reaction:**

Face in hands. "I hate everything."

Standard practice: She removes enchantment after puzzle solved. No longer watching.

### The Unknown Watcher Message

**But there was MORE:**

The unknown watcher - the ACTUAL surveillance - responded to Eden's ward message.

**The Message:**

---

*"Well done, Investigator. Three accelerationists eliminated. Impressive work.*

*We should meet. Discuss mutual interests.*

*When you're ready, return to where it began. Alone. I'll find you.*

*- A Friend"*

---

**Analysis:**

**"Where it began":** Thornhaven

**"A Friend":** Deliberately vague. Not a name or title.

**"Alone":** Trust test.

### Eden's Theory

**First Instinct:**

Could this be the third reformist exarch who hasn't surfaced yet?

**Support for Theory:**

- Kethris confirmed: Vahlen the Warden (third reformist) has been dark since accelerationists became aggressive
- Vahlen is cautious, strategic, watches before acting
- Thornhaven significant: where Eden extracted Kethris, proved exarch-handling capability
- Timeline fits: surveillance started when Eden became operationally visible
- "Mutual interests" = reformist goals (Bhaal resurrection on their terms)
- Eden just eliminated accelerationist opposition

**Brecht and Celeste:** Both agreed it's plausible.

### The Risk Assessment

**Not just the meeting itself:**

The ROAD to Thornhaven is where cultists ambushed Eden's team before.

**Potential Dangers:**
1. Road ambush by remaining Bhaal cultists (angry about accelerationist deaths)
2. Meeting could be a trap (using "alone" to isolate)
3. Two-day journey each way through hostile territory

**Eden's Analysis:**

*"Going alone is doubly dangerous. Road ambush AND potentially hostile meeting."*

### The Security Arrangement

**The Compromise:**

Heightened security along the route - plausibly deniable as standard protection for Crown official in known hostile territory.

But Eden goes ALONE to the actual meeting point in Thornhaven.

**Brecht's Plan:**

Crown forces positioned along route. Discrete. Far enough back to not spook contact, close enough to respond to cultist attack.

**Celeste's Addition:**

Temple paladins disguised as travelers. Different units, different cover stories.

**Protection Detail:**

Thorne and guards travel WITH Eden to Thornhaven outskirts. Only the final meeting is alone.

**The Logic:**

The watcher would EXPECT heightened security on the road. Eden has a target on his back from previous cultist ambush.

As long as it's plausibly deniable and not actively accompanying him, they'll notice but understand.

**They wouldn't be much of a friend if they didn't care about Eden's safety.**

### The Timeline

**Day 15 (tomorrow):** Depart morning, travel
**Day 16:** Continue travel, arrive Thornhaven evening
**Day 17:** Meeting
**Day 18-19:** Return journey

**Five days total.**

---

## Telling Aldrin

**The Archives - Late Evening**

Found Aldrin still working. Midnight Violets in vase on desk (visible reminder of the day).

**Eden's Briefing:**

Explained everything: scrying sensor (puzzle enthusiast), unknown watcher message, decision to go, security arrangements.

**Aldrin's Reaction:**

*"Your first solo operation. To meet an unknown entity who's been surveilling you. Alone."*

Quiet. Processing.

*"I spent twenty years preparing you for this. And now that you're doing it, I'm terrified."*

**The Hug:**

Aldrin pulled Eden into tight hug. *"Come back. Whatever happens in Thornhaven, come back."*

**The Permission:**

*"Your mother would tell me I'm being overprotective. But she'd also be terrified. So I'm doing it for both of us."*

**The Humor Covering Fear:**

*"Come home. Because I have tea scheduled with Kethris next week and she'll be very disappointed if I have to cancel because my son didn't come back."*

Using humor to cover terror. Eden recognizes it because he does the same.

**Aldrin's Admission:**

*"It's not a DATE, it's— It might be a date. I'm not sure yet. We're figuring it out."*

Just like Eden and Lyren.

---

## Telling Lyren

**Temple - Kethris's Recovery Room**

Found Lyren with her mother. Both immediately knew something was wrong.

**Eden's Question:**

*"The mysterious watcher made contact. There's reason to believe it's the third reformist. Kethris, can you confirm or deny?"*

**Kethris's Intel:**

**Vahlen the Warden.** Third reformist exarch.

- Cautious, strategic, watches before acting
- Been dark since accelerationists aggressive
- Thornhaven significant to him (Eden's extraction of Kethris)
- Could absolutely be him

**Lyren's Immediate Response:**

*"You're going. Aren't you?"*

*"Tomorrow morning."*

*"Alone?"*

*"I'm coming with you."*

*"No."*

**The Argument:**

Lyren: *"So you're just going to walk into potential danger by yourself because someone you've never met asked nicely?"*

Eden: *"Yes."*

*"That's STUPID."*

*"It's tactical."*

*"It's STUPID and TACTICAL."*

**The Protocol Invoked:**

*"We JUST established relationship protocols. One of them was 'tell me when something dangerous is happening.' This is dangerous!"*

**Eden's Response:**

*"And it's happening."*

**The Acceptance:**

Lyren processing. Hating it. But understanding.

*"I hate this. I hate that you're right. I hate that I have to just wait here while you're in danger. And I hate that we JUST figured out 'whatever this is' and now you're leaving."*

Eden: *"I'll be back in five days."*

*"You better be. Because we have a third date scheduled."*

### The Solution

**Eden's Offer:**

*"You don't have to wait. There are things you can do."*

**The Gift:**

Take Tormund's *Principia Arcana* from Eden's quarters. Learn divination basics.

**The Purpose:**

She can keep tabs on him from anywhere. Channel anxiety into skill-building.

Brecht will give her security clearance on Eden's whereabouts.

**Become his kind of librarian.**

**Lyren's Reaction:**

*"You want me to learn DIVINATION? So I can track you when you're on operations?"*

*"That's actually brilliant. Instead of just worrying, I'd be actively monitoring."*

**The Trust:**

Eden giving her:
- His mentor's book
- Security clearance to his location data
- Tools to engage with his work, not just wait on sidelines

**Kethris's Observation:**

*"That's trust. And love. Even if you're wrapping it in operational language."*

**The Kiss:**

Right there in front of her mother. Don't care.

**The Agreement:**

Lyren: *"I'll learn divination. I'll track you. And when you get back, you're teaching me Augury."*

*"Deal."*

**Five days.**

---

## The Catastrophic Marriage Comment

**Eden's Attempt at Being Casual:**

*"You know, I'd say we might never figure out what this is until we look back and realize we're married with two kids, but setting milestones would be operational."*

**Lyren's Reaction:**

*"Did you just casually mention MARRIAGE and KIDS while trying to say we shouldn't set milestones?"*

**The Backpedaling:**

Eden tried to explain it was hypothetical, illustrative, not actual—

**The Reality:**

Lyren: *"You used MARRIAGE as an EXAMPLE. You can't just SAY that and then backtrack!"*

*"You've thought about it. You disaster."*

**The New Rule:**

No mentioning marriage or kids until at LEAST six months. A year.

**But:**

Lyren (quietly): *"It wasn't a terrible hypothetical. Scary. Way too soon. But not terrible."*

**Eden's Internal Panic:**

*(Great. Now she'll be divining whether we'll have a boy or girl first rather than tracking me. Tactical error.)*

## Character Development

### Eden's Growth

**Romantic Competence: Improving (Barely)**

From fetal position on Day 12 to:
- First kiss with confidence ("shut your mouth")
- Holding hands in public
- Tactical relationship protocols
- Trusting partner with operational information
- ...accidentally mentioning marriage after two days

**Operational Maturity:**

- Recognizing security needs without paranoia
- Balancing "alone" request with practical safety
- Thinking through road ambush risks
- Establishing clear protocols before dangerous mission

**Emotional Intelligence:**

- Supporting father's relationship without making it weird
- Giving Lyren tools instead of trying to protect her
- Communicating dangers honestly within security constraints
- Understanding difference between protection and partnership

**The Marriage Comment:**

Peak Eden disaster energy. Trying to make a point about not setting milestones BY USING MARRIAGE AS THE EXAMPLE.

Will never be allowed to forget this.

### Lyren's Development

**From Protector to Partner:**

Not just worried about Eden - actively preparing to support him operationally.

Learning divination to track him. Becoming his kind of librarian.

**Emotional Processing:**

- Hates that he's leaving
- Hates that he's right about going
- Chooses productive worry over passive fear
- Establishes she can handle the danger

**The Marriage Response:**

Scared but not terrible. Acknowledging feelings while maintaining boundaries.

Smart enough to laugh at Eden's disaster energy while also being touched by the sentiment.

### Aldrin's Transformation

**From Withdrawn Scholar to Person:**

- Having tea dates (might be dates, figuring it out)
- Getting reading homework from Kethris
- Buying flowers
- Lighting up when talking about passions
- Admitting he's terrified but letting Eden go anyway

**The Pattern Recognition:**

Sees himself in Eden. Both terrible at emotions. Both need assertive partners.

History rhyming beautifully.

### Kethris's Revelation

**The Gardener:**

Not just reformist exarch. Someone who tends living cycles.

40 years cultivating Midnight Violets. Remembering mortality through growth and decay.

**The Pursuer:**

Like Eden's mother pursued Aldrin, Kethris is gently pursuing Aldrin.

Making him remember he's allowed to be excited. To be a person.

Weekly tea. Mandatory humanity.

---

## Relationships

### Eden & Lyren

**Status:** "Whatever this is" (with operational protocols and accidental marriage mentions)

**Milestones:**
- First kiss (Day 13, conservatory)
- Second kiss (Day 13, gardens)
- Multiple kisses (Day 14, city)
- Holding hands in public
- Meeting each other's parents (double date)
- Established relationship protocols
- Divination partnership

**The Dynamic:**

She's assertive, he's tactical. She pursues, he analyzes. Both disasters in complementary ways.

Trust: He's giving her his mentor's book and security clearance. She's learning to track him operationally.

**The Unspoken:**

Marriage comment aside, both thinking long-term. Scared but hopeful. Figuring it out together.

### Aldrin & Kethris

**Status:** Weekly tea dates (might be dates, figuring it out)

**The Connection:**

Books vs Gardens. Preservation vs Cycles. Information vs Living things.

Complementary approaches to meaning and permanence.

**What They're Doing:**

- Weekly tea (non-negotiable)
- Mandatory humanity time
- Reading assignments (Kethris making Aldrin read for enjoyment)
- Temple garden visits planned
- Both remembering how to be people instead of just roles

**The Parallel:**

Both shaped by loss (his wife, her mortal life). Both disappeared into work. Both being pulled back by assertive partner.

Just like their children.

### The Family Dynamic

**Four Disasters Together:**

Two pairs figuring out romance simultaneously. Supporting each other. Teasing each other.

Dinner together. City outings. Shared enthusiasm for analyzing everything.

**The Meta-Awareness:**

All four recognize they're "not normal" and stopped trying. Just being themselves - tactical, analytical, earnest.

**Fang's Role:**

Witnessed everything. Mortified by kisses. Enormously satisfied with outcomes.

Wise and observant familiar who knows more about normal people than any of them.

---

## Themes Explored

### Parallel Romances

Both Sagebough men:
- Brilliant but isolated
- Disappear into work
- Terrible at emotions
- Being pursued by assertive women
- Need someone to pull them out

Both women:
- Assertive and direct
- Make the men do human things
- Connect through shared passions
- Patient with disaster energy

History rhyming beautifully.

### Trust vs Protection

**Eden's Learning:**

Protection = keeping someone safe by excluding them

Trust = giving someone tools to engage with danger

**The Shift:**

From "I need to protect Lyren from my job" to "I need to give Lyren the tools to understand and engage with my job."

Divination book. Security clearance. Operational protocols.

Partnership, not protection.

### Operational vs Emotional

**The Blend:**

Eden processes emotions through operational frameworks. Relationship protocols. Security arrangements. Documentation impulses.

But it WORKS. Because both he and Lyren think this way.

**The Balance:**

Protocols don't replace communication. Structure doesn't replace trust. Planning doesn't replace feelings.

But for them, it helps. It's their love language.

### Finding Time

**The Reality:**

Tomorrow Eden returns to dangerous work. Five-day solo operation. More after that.

**The Commitment:**

They'll find time. Between crises. Between investigations. For pastries and games and not-complicated nice things.

Because it's worth it.

### Being Disasters Together

**The Acceptance:**

Stopped trying to be normal. Just being themselves - analytical, tactical, earnest, awkward.

All four of them. Different flavors of disaster. But good together.

---

## Magic & Mechanics

### Portent Usage (Day 13)

**Roll:** 11 and 3

**Strategic Application:**

- Saved both for maximum impact (didn't use on initiative)
- Burned 11 to turn 2 into 11 gold (psychological impact, took the lead)
- Used 3 to sabotage Lyren's 5 into 3 (prevented her near-victory)

**Result:** Won game through combination of strategy and insane dice luck (three nat 6s).

### Portent (Day 14)

**Roll:** 9 and 14

Functional. Not dramatic. Good for a day meant for enjoying things, not fighting.

**Usage:** None. Didn't need them.

### The Divination Gift

**Tormund's *Principia Arcana*:**

Practical divination basics. Step-by-step instruction.

Eden trusting Lyren with:
- His mentor's teaching
- Divination techniques
- Ability to track him during operations

**The Plan:**

Lyren learning basics in five days while Eden is gone. When he returns, he teaches her Augury.

Operational partnership. Intelligence sharing.

### Skills Not Used

**Meditation:** Still terrible at it. Gave up trying.

**Normalcy:** Attempted, failed, stopped trying.

**Emotional Competence:** Improving but still catastrophic (see: marriage comment).

## The Thornhaven Mission

### The Assignment

**Objective:** Meet unknown watcher ("A Friend") in Thornhaven

**Timeline:** 5 days total
- Day 15: Depart, travel
- Day 16: Travel, arrive evening
- Day 17: Meeting
- Day 18-19: Return

**Security:**
- Crown forces along route (discrete)
- Temple paladins (disguised travelers)
- Thorne + protection detail to outskirts
- Eden goes ALONE to actual meeting

**Risk Assessment:**
1. Road cultist ambush (known threat, previous attempt)
2. Meeting could be trap
3. Unknown entity's true intentions
4. Two-day journey each way through hostile territory

**Theory:**

Most likely Vahlen the Warden (third reformist exarch). Strategic, cautious, wants alliance now that accelerationists eliminated.

**Backup Plan:**

Plausibly deniable security. If attacked, overwhelming response ready. But meeting itself is trust test - Eden goes alone.

---

## Unresolved Threads

**The Thornhaven Meeting:**

Who is "A Friend"? Vahlen? Someone else? What do they want?

**The Cultists:**

Are any remaining after accelerationist deaths? Will they ambush the road again?

**The Marriage Comment:**

Lyren will NEVER let Eden live this down. It's canon now.

**Aldrin & Kethris:**

Where does their relationship go? Is it a date? They're figuring it out.

**Lyren's Divination Training:**

Can she actually learn tracking magic in five days? Will she be monitoring Eden or baby names? (Probably both.)

**Third Date:**

Eden promised to be back for it. After third date = will-writing discussion territory.

**Return to Duty:**

After Thornhaven: what's next? Unknown watcher might become ally. Or threat. Or both.

## Next Session Preview

**Day 15-19: The Thornhaven Journey**

**The Questions:**
- Who is "A Friend"?
- Is it really Vahlen the Warden?
- Will cultists ambush the road?
- What do they want from Eden?
- Can Eden survive five days without seeing Lyren?
- Can Lyren learn divination without getting distracted by baby name Auguries?
- Will Aldrin survive his second tea date with Kethris?
- Can Eden return safely for third date / will-writing discussion?

**The Stakes:**

First solo operation. Unknown entity. Hostile territory. Five days away from newly-established relationship.

And somewhere in Thornhaven, someone who's been watching Eden for two weeks is waiting to meet him.

Alone.
