    15	## Notes
    16	Major session focused on clever problem-solving. Eden bypassed Flesh to Stone trap using rope and physics rather than magic. Successfully deceived a god by keeping grimoires' true location secret. All three stolen grimoires verified and secured. Party preparing for capital journey tomorrow.
