SESSION 15 - COMPLETE
Days 18-19
DAY 18 MORNING

Vahlen oath verified by Brother Thaddeus. No loopholes. "Final death" clause confirmed as signal of long-term commitment. Thaddeus noted Helm's wards "liked Eden fine."
Eden visited Kethris in healing ward. Handoff conversation. Maternal approval effectively given.
Key exchange: "The strings don't make you reckless - they make you honest about what you're risking."
Fang/Whisper: Six inches to one inch on windowsill. Unprecedented for Whisper in 43 years. Whisper asked Kethris whether familiars could want things for themselves.
Lunch with Aldrin and Kethris. Aldrin's courtship history revealed: fourteen footnotes, dress code appendix with three configurations. Kethris wore Configuration C deliberately. Aldrin sent revised appendix next morning with footnote 15.
Eden/Lyren relationship terminology established: "strings" preferred. "Boyfriend/girlfriend" acceptable.

DAY 18 AFTERNOON - CONSERVATORY

Third board game begins. Eden plays aggressive opening to prevent Lyren generalizing.
Cross-map bishop snipe. "SHOULD'VE SEEN IT COMING. HA."
Lyren: "I love you." Surprised out of her mid-argument.
Eden: "I love you too. From move two."
Third game left incomplete. Symbolic. Ongoing.
SAFE WORD ESTABLISHED: Wooden Raven. Origin: puzzle box statuette, Session 13. Found Eden at his lowest. Lyren present. Chosen because it cuts through to Eden-at-his-lowest, not Eden-the-operator.
Eden disclosed fear of selfishness, of treating people as means to ends. Lyren: "That's someone terrified of becoming one."
Pipeline discussion. Established as bidirectional but asymmetric - Eden leaks constantly, Lyren still learning it's safe to leak.

DAY 18 EVENING

Abjuration homework. Eden teaches from experience not book.
Key framework established: Captain/First Mate. Captain = reason/operational composure. First Mate = emotional/physical desire. Same ship, same destination. Not mutiny - navigation.
(Note: "First mate" originated as Eden's internal euphemism for physical desire. Fang knew. Handled with diplomacy and "exercise one." Became broader framework.)
The Pipeline formally understood as feature not bug. Fang brokers both ends. Whisper→Kethris→Lyren. Bidirectional but Eden leaks more.
"Obviously" mind virus: Patient zero Fang. Transmitted to Lyren, Aldrin, Kethris, Tormund, Thorne. Eden immune but surrounded.
Aldrin/Kethris: Midnight violets on desk (pre-tea). Footnote three in Kethris's handwriting: "Footnotes are an acceptable love language." Contact made. Active file. No longer pending.
Footnote six added: dinner after Temple garden visit. Together confirmed.

DAY 19 MORNING - TORMUND'S LESSON (LYREN)

Lyren's first formal lesson. Key word: "Jurisdiction" - her word, not in the book.
Tormund: "She made the Weave move on her fourth day."
Lyren stopped seven corks without spell slots. Tormund: "I don't have a classification for this."
Framework: Lyren has been reading the Weave for 25 years via Whisper proximity + 8 months cult cell survival instinct. The Weave already knows her. Magic feels like flashing an ID and acting like you belong.
Likely classification: Aberrant Mind Sorcerer variant, drawing on Bhaal-adjacent divine exposure through Kethris/Whisper. Presence-based rather than slot-based. Bypasses normal magical infrastructure.
Mechanical framework: Not truly at-will. Costs presence not slots. Vulnerable to surprise, emotional compromise, pipeline flooding. Hard to hit. Nearly impossible to surprise.
Eden chastised for interrupting lesson. Assigned exercise one again.
Post-lesson: Tower corridor kiss. First mate considerably appeased.
Tormund conversation: Eden to follow lessons alongside Lyren. Signal through pipeline changes from distraction to resonance. Shared presence without interference.
Kethris requested for next Tuesday with Whisper. Tormund wants to understand the 25-year inadvertent education.

DAY 19 AFTERNOON - CONSERVATORY

Lyren's new journal from Tormund. Documents Weave movements.
Pipeline used deliberately for first time. Lyren transmits intentionally.
Eden locates Lyren's emotional source in the Weave. Points to it gently without demanding anything.
Lyren: "I am here." Written in journal. Practice transmission.
Conservatory kiss. Third and most deliberate. Both hands on his face. Chosen. Present. Not performed.
"There it is." Both of them.

DAY 19 EVENING - OPERATION

Tavin Coors moved. River district. Anchor's Rest.
Lyren deployed as primary asset. Fang accompanies. Pipeline as operational intelligence channel.
4 burned (Portent): Coors fails Insight check on Lyren. She passes unnoticed.
17 remaining.
Intelligence gathered: Councillor Maren Holt meeting Coors. Blackwater associate. Infrastructure portfolio.
Holt received delivery from Coors. Was expecting third party who didn't show.
Lyren's read: Third party trusted. Personal connection. Felt abandoned not just stood up.
V didn't show.
Brecht debrief: Full disclosure including personal investment conflict. Lyren officially welcomed to Crown apparatus (unofficial). Holt under watch. Blackwater adjacent but unconfirmed. No movement yet.

DAY 19 NIGHT - HEALING WARD

Aldrin and Kethris discovered (reading aloud, botanical text, midnight violets).
Kethris reveals: Holt attended three reformist theological discussions two years ago. Flagged to Vahlen as "interested." Mapping jurisdictional conflicts between Crown and divine authority.
Vahlen manifests. Reveals: Holt made contact with someone inside reformist movement 8 months ago. That person was eliminated. Just before the period of escalating reformist tension.
Serath introduced. Someone who died in Bhaal's service and didn't quite finish dying. Has been administering Bhaal's portfolio unofficially. Was waiting for someone to propose the right framework.
Eden's proposal: Middle path between accelerationist and reformist positions. Crown-sanctioned targeted purge of genuine evil. Necessary deaths only. Nobody innocent. Feeds Bhaal's coherence through purposeful rather than random death.
Divine Council framework proposed:

Exarchs commit divine essence in escrow (final death stakes for bad faith)
Reports delivered through theological/intelligence channels to the King
Helm of Helm as neutral drafter and notary (Protection of the innocent = perfect portfolio fit)
Independent target verification before Crown authority moves
Helm reports directly to King if council crosses the line
Deliberate enough to be moral. Fast enough to be useful.


Vahlen: In.
Serath: In.
Kethris: In (implicitly).
Next step: Brief Brother Thaddeus. First bell tomorrow.
King must be informed. Everything built without his knowledge is built on sand.
V's endgame identified: Control whoever speaks for Bhaal. Not theological - political. Power over a god.
V is not accelerationist or reformist. V is using both sides. Has been for at least two years minimum.

THORNE NOTE:
Thorne has been on Eden's detail consistently. Has filed approximately forty pages. Has requested the assignment. Is in the polygon. Used "obviously" in Brecht's office. Brecht may also be infected.
KEY CANONICALS:

Safe word: Wooden Raven
"I love you" - mutual, deliberate, conservatory
Lyren: unclassified caster, presence-based, Weave-familiar
Captain/First Mate framework established
Pipeline: bidirectional, Fang brokers, asymmetric leak rates
Aldrin/Kethris: Active file, footnote six, dinner, contact made
Divine Council: proposed, two exarchs committed, Helm oversight, King briefing pending
Serath: exists, named, in
V: political not theological, endgame = control divine succession, didn't show Day 19
Holt: Blackwater adjacent, Crown Councillor, compromised
Portent remaining: 17

PENDING:
