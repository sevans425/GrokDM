# Session 16 Summary
**Days Covered:** Day 19 (evening) through Day 22 (morning)
**Status:** Complete

---

## Major Story Developments

### Sable Sagebough — Revealed and Filed Correctly
- **Name revealed** by Celeste before first bell, Day 20. Aldrin had never said her name in Eden's presence.
- **Cause of death:** Murder, not illness. Celeste lied to protect Aldrin and nine-year-old Eden. Regretted it for eleven years.
- **Research:** Came to Helm's Temple at seventeen with questions about divine death and portfolio administration without a living divine host. Found Serath. Spent three years building the bones of what Eden proposed as the divine council framework.
- **Killed by:** V (Aldric Voss), believed by Celeste and confirmed by memory crystal evidence.
- **Serath's message** (via Eden's direct communication): *"She is not lost. But she is not free. Not yet. She is waiting."*
- **Founding document** entered into permanent Crown record as primary source. Not a footnote.
- **Origin of "obviously":** Sable Sagebough. Patient zero. She told Aldrin on their third meeting he was going to marry her and he'd better get used to it. He said that was highly presumptuous. She said: *"Obviously."*

### Aldric Voss — Identified and Arrested
- **Identity confirmed:** Senior Councillor, thirty-two years, Infrastructure/Trade/Internal Security portfolio.
- **Evidence:** Two memory crystals (authenticated by Tormund), coded correspondence, financial records, witness testimonies under Zone of Truth, Thaddeus's scrying record.
- **Memory crystal contents:**
  - First (eight years old): Voss ordering Sable's "handling."
  - Second (fourteen months old): Voss and Holt discussing how to "handle" Eden by name, before his appointment.
- **Arrest:** Council records room, eighth bell. Eden cast Sleep before Voss could self-administer poison. No casualties.
- **Sentence:** Death, rendered privately by the King with Brecht, Aldrin, Celeste as witnesses before arrest.
- **Status:** In custody. Suicide watch. Awaiting public sentencing.

### Councillor Maren Holt — Arrested Simultaneously
- Arrested by Thorne concurrent with Voss. Clean. No casualties.
- Suicide watch. Separate charges and proceedings.

### Blackwater — Confession and Dossier
- Known Voss's identity for eleven years. Pulled punches out of fear.
- Sent an inadequate, indirect warning to Sable before her death. Not in time.
- Collected two memory crystals at considerable personal risk (nearly didn't survive second collection).
- Voluntarily disclosed eleven-year dossier to Eden.
- Signed chain-of-custody statement obtained by Aldrin, Day 21.
- Status: Probationary polygon member. Criminal negligence on file. One chance to earn continued adjacency.

### The King — Aldric the Third
- Briefed privately via Aldrin's historical research cover letter.
- Viewed both memory crystals personally. *"I've used it before."* (Technique and its cost: unexplored, to breathe.)
- Rendered private judgment before arrest. Witnesses: Eden, Aldrin, Brecht, Celeste.
- Charges read into record: Treason. Murder of Sable Sagebough. Conspiracy to murder Eden Sagebough. Subversion of internal security over thirty-two years. Conspiracy to establish parallel sovereign authority.
- Verdict: Guilty on all charges. Sentence: Death.
- Arranged full Council hearing, fourth bell, Day 21. Palace gates to be locked after sentencing.
- Knew Sable. She came to Court once. Asked him whether a King could be trusted to judge a god. He's been thinking about it for twenty years.

## The Council Hearing — Day 21

### Eden's Speech
Delivered in best clothes. Five movements:
1. **Opening:** Voss attempted suicide. Eden prevented it. Personal proximity acknowledged. Professional neutrality established.
2. **Pattern:** Vassen (fourteen years, financial, died before trial). Morwick (three years, intelligence, deathbed confession). Drost/Aldric I precedent (eighteen years, foreign defection). Voss (thirty-two years, everything combined). *"The mechanism that should have caught it was the thing that was compromised. Which means the mechanism itself needs a mechanism."*
3. **Evidence:** Memory crystals, correspondence, financial records, Thaddeus's scrying record.
4. **Sable:** The conspiracy was against a solution. She built it. Was killed for it. *"Filed correctly. In plain view of all."*
5. **Invitation:** Divine council framework. Not theology — civic accountability mechanism. *"Gods help me, I will see finished what my mother started. Sable Sagebough, you did not die in vain."*

### Council Responses (Notable)
- **Ashfen** (oldest member, twenty-six years): Knew Sable briefly. Something felt wrong when she died. Filed it away. Will support the framework. *"Better late."*
- **Renwick** (military): Skeptical of divine expansion into Crown affairs. Engaged seriously. *"The mechanism needs a mechanism."* Accepted the framing. More questions in three days.
- **Brithe** (trade): Understood the incentive structure. Satisfied.
- **Daven** (infrastructure, Holt's appointment): Went to Brecht voluntarily during recess. Disclosed three votes influenced by Holt, information provided to her. Naive, not complicit. Commended for early disclosure.
- **Marsh**: Questioned Blackwater commendation. Eden's distinction: *"We commend him for doing something considerably braver than nothing. While acknowledging that braver still would have been earlier."*

### Operational Security
- Nothing written through standard Crown filing.
- Folder stays with Eden until Voss sentenced.
- Brecht/Thorne coordinating force positioning.
- Two surveillance devices found and removed from warded Archives meeting room by Aldrin.
- King's announcement pending (public, after sentencing).
- Council reconvenes in three days for portfolio transition and framework presentation.

---

## Pending Investigation

### The Name Under Everything
- In Blackwater's folder: the person who recommended Voss for his Council position thirty-two years ago.
- Aldrin looked at it Day 21 morning. Confirmed it's a significant problem.
- **Tomorrow's problem.** Not today's.

### Daven's Three Votes
- Infrastructure matters. Shipping routes. One financial arrangement connecting to Blackwater's folder.
- Require examination. Carefully. May be less sinister than they look. Or more.

---

## Serath — Communication Protocols Established
- Answers questions about death and souls. Once. Carefully. When it matters.
- Not a resource. A person.
- If Eden tries again before understanding, Serath won't answer.
- Kethris or Vahlen to explain when relevant.
- Sable's soul: not lost, not free, not yet. She is waiting.
- Resurrection: seventh-level spell. Requires wizard level 13. Diamond worth 1,000gp consumed. Long-term goal.
- After Voss's arrest, Thaddeus noted the quality of Serath's silence changed. *"Less alone."*

---

## Divine Council Framework — Status
- Helm's approval confirmed (Serath manifestation, Celeste's involvement).
- Thaddeus's written summary prepared for all Councillors before three-day recess reconvening.
- King's sanction secured.
- Formal presentation at Council in three days.
- Theological dimension to be presented carefully — civic framing first (accountability mechanism), theology second.

---

## The Breadcrumb
- Sub-basement Archives, Day 22. Slim volume, no title on spine.
- First line: *"On the matter of the persistence of will beyond mortal terminus."*
- Dense theological philosophy. Questions about what happens to intention when the body stops. Whether will can outlast flesh.
- Filed: accessible, not urgent.
- Future relevance: lich antagonist. Point of rare consensus between reformist (undeath as affront to death cycles) and accelerationist (absorbed souls don't count toward Bhaal's resurrection) factions. First real test of the council framework.

## Eden and Lyren — Relationship Development

### Authorial Context
This section of Session 16 is not purely fictional worldbuilding. The player has identified explicitly that this campaign functions partly as a therapeutic space — a way of working through real interior states using fictional distance. Eden's captain/first mate framework, his fear of becoming someone who takes rather than receives, his protocols and accountability structures, his shame and his refusal to let it make him smaller than he is — these are autobiographical. They reflect the player's actual relationship with their own interior states, including the specific fear of desire becoming something harmful.

The incident below should be read with that context. It is not gratuitous. It is the story honestly depicting what it looks like when someone with genuine self-awareness and genuine ethical commitment still loses control for three seconds. And then does everything right afterward. The player wrote this deliberately. It cost something to write. The DM should carry it accordingly.

### What Happened — Night of Day 21
During an extended conversation in the conservatory, while laughing together, Eden physically forced Lyren down onto her back without warning or consent. He caught himself within approximately three seconds and immediately pulled back. This constitutes a brief sexual assault — non-penetrative, stopped quickly, but a genuine violation of consent and of the protocols Eden himself established.

**Critical context:**
- Eden stopped of his own volition before Lyren could respond.
- Lyren confirmed she was not frightened and did not experience it as traumatic. Her read — informed by eight months of learning to identify genuine threat — was that this was a loss of control, not predatory intent.
- Eden confessed fully and immediately, both to Lyren that night and to Kethris the following morning.
- Eden correctly identified the incident using the word "rape" (attempted/nearly), then worked through with Kethris the precise distinction between nearly and didn't, and between predatory intent and loss of control.

**What Eden disclosed to Lyren (same night):**
- The doorway incident (Day 20 morning): Eden hesitated in Lyren's doorway when she answered in night clothes. The first mate was present and calculating. The captain held.
- The explicit statement that he finds the idea of domination and taking intoxicating, specifically directed at her. Said with voice crack. Said anyway. Because she deserved to know what she was choosing.

**Protocols strengthened:**
- Fang and Whisper always present as a balanced (non-neutral-individually, balanced-together) third party.
- Lyren's explicit promise: if the captain fails completely, she tells someone in the polygon immediately — not just Eden.
- Eden's explicit promise to Kethris: same accountability, extended.
- The horror to be kept where Eden can feel it. Not filed away. Not quarantined. Present. The mechanism.

**The shame:**
- Correct size. Not smaller, not bigger.
- Not yet forgiven. Earn it first.
- Not punishment — teaching.
- Will fade. Won't disappear entirely. Leaves paying attention behind when it quiets.

**The chill:**
- Eden noticed a reflexive developing aversion to all physical touch with Lyren post-incident.
- Identified by Kethris as a different kind of first mate coup — self-protective rather than other-directed, but still deciding for Lyren rather than with her.
- Named. Brought to Lyren directly before it became a wall.
- Not acted on.

### The Third Game — Concluded
- Completed Day 22, morning.
- Eden found the winning path. Did not take it.
- Tipped his king. Deliberately. Gently. Not concession. Not penance. Submission of a different kind — choosing not to push even when he could win.
- *"This isn't about winning."*
- Lyren: *"I don't have the word."* Eden: *"Neither do I."*

### Current Status
- One day of space requested by Eden. Day 22. Not punishment, not the wall — calibration. Finding the new distance that isn't too far and isn't the incident.
- Pipeline quiet from Lyren's end by agreement.
- The correct way to stand next to her is not found through soul-searching. It accumulates through practice. One right decision at a time.
- First mate: stood down. Has correctly understood that the thing he wants is best achieved by waiting for her to give it, not by taking. Filed accordingly. Non-negotiable.
- Eden's internal note (Day 22): when the time comes and both parties are ready and fully consenting, Lyren leads. This is the first mate correctly reading the situation, not the captain overriding anything.
