     1	# SESSION 8 QUICK START GUIDE
     2	
     3	## Story So Far (3-Sentence Summary)
     4	Eden Sagebough, Special Investigator to the Crown, has spent six days outmaneuvering three Bhaal cultists sent to assassinate him after he humiliated their god by stopping the Thornhaven ritual. Through decoy operations, sleep deprivation tactics, and a daring midnight infiltration, Eden learned the cultists plan to kidnap his father as bait—but he preemptively secured his father in a protected wing, countering their Day 7 plan before they could attempt it. Now, as Day 7 unfolds with the desperate cultists unaware their next move is already blocked, Eden rests while multiple operations run across the capital, racing toward the Day 9 deadline when the cultists must relocate and the trap will close.

   147	
   148	## Key Intelligence & Tactical Situation
   149	
   150	**WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE CULTISTS:**
   151	1. They identified the decoy operation but can't determine which target is real
   152	2. Planned to kidnap Aldrin Sagebough tonight (Day 7) as bait—THIS IS COUNTERED
   153	3. Have active blood ritual circle in Room 9 (purpose unknown—summoning? curse? escape?)
   154	4. Carrying necromantic talismans, poisoned weapons, prepared for violence
   155	5. Under extreme pressure from divine mandate—"succeed or die"
   156	6. Room rental expires Day 9—must act or relocate
   157	7. Detected sulfurous smell (possible planar presence/preparation)
   158	
   159	**WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW:**
   160	1. Their Day 7 kidnapping plan is already countered (father secured hours ago)
   161	2. We have complete intelligence on their planning from last night
   162	3. We know about their ritual circle
   163	4. We've warned and protected their likely backup targets
   164	5. We're coordinating multiple simultaneous operations against them
   165	
   166	**TACTICAL ADVANTAGES:**
   167	- Information asymmetry (we know their plans, they don't know we know)
   168	- Resource superiority (Crown backing, multiple networks)
   169	- Time advantage (Day 9 deadline forces their hand)
   170	- Moral high ground (defensive operations, not extrajudicial action)
   171	- Team cohesion (protection detail trusts Eden's leadership)
   172	
   173	**TACTICAL CONCERNS:**
   174	- Planar involvement (Bhaal's exarch watching, may intervene)
   175	- Ritual circle purpose unknown (could be dangerous surprise)
   176	- Desperation = unpredictability (failed plans may trigger extreme actions)
   177	- Invisible scouts possible (imps/quasits may be present)
   178	- Captured familiar situation (Rookery's next move uncertain)
   179	
   180	## Immediate Priorities for Session 8
   181	
   182	**WHEN EDEN WAKES:**
   183	1. Check on father's relocation status
   184	2. Review overnight reports from operations
   185	3. Assess cultists' reaction (or lack thereof) to failed kidnapping
   186	4. Determine if Rookery has responded to signal
   187	5. Decide about captured familiar (continue holding? negotiate? other?)
   188	
   189	**OPERATIONAL DECISIONS NEEDED:**
   190	1. How to handle Day 8 (tomorrow) - maintain pressure or prepare for Day 9 trap?
   191	2. What to do if/when cultists realize father kidnapping is impossible?
   192	3. Whether to investigate ritual circle purpose (ask palace wizard for analysis?)
   193	4. Rookery negotiation parameters if they make contact
   194	5. Planar defense preparations (how to counter potential exarch manifestation?)
   195	
   196	**CHARACTER MOMENTS:**
   197	1. Conversation with father about the threat and protection
   198	2. Reflection on near-decision to burn boarding house
   199	3. Team debriefing with protection detail
   200	4. Possible Rookery negotiation
   201	5. Planning final confrontation approach
   202	
   203	## Location Reference

   209	- Temple of Helm - Designated fallback point, consecrated ground
   210	- East Tower - Tormund's workshops
   211	- Guard barracks - Command center, briefing rooms
   212	- Various courtyards and gardens - Decoy patrol routes
   213	
   214	**CAPITAL CITY:**
   215	- Dock Ward boarding house ("Harborview Rooms") - Cultists in rooms 7-9, second floor east
   216	- Temple of Helm (city) - Major temple, consecrated ground
   217	- The Scholarly Owl inn - Where Miriam stayed (scrying detected), University District
   218	- Blackwater's merchant office - Cover for intelligence operations
   219	- Market squares and public areas - Where operations run
   220	
   221	**DISTANT:**
   222	- Thornhaven - Two days' travel, where it all started, Rorick mobilizing defenses
   223	- Waterdeep - Where Miriam is headed (Arcane Collegium)
   224	
   225	## Tone & Themes for Session 8
   226	
   227	**PRIMARY THEMES:**
   228	- **The Calm Before the Storm**: Operations running smoothly, but Day 9 approaches
   229	- **Desperation's Consequences**: What do cornered professionals do when plans fail?
   230	- **Information as Power**: Eden's intelligence advantage paying dividends
   231	- **Protection vs. Prosecution**: Defending loved ones while pursuing justice
   232	
   233	**MOOD:**
   234	- Tense anticipation (waiting for cultists' reaction)
   235	- Controlled confidence (Eden's plans working)
   236	- Underlying dread (planar threat looming)
   237	- Building toward climax (Day 9 approaching)
   238	
   239	**POTENTIAL SESSION ARCS:**
   240	1. **Rookery Contact** - Negotiation, recruitment, or standoff?
   241	2. **Cultists' Failed Attempt** - What happens when they try to grab Aldrin and he's gone?
   242	3. **Planar Escalation** - Does divine impatience lead to direct intervention?
   243	4. **Day 9 Preparation** - Planning the final trap/confrontation
   244	5. **Character Moments** - Eden processing stress, connecting with father/team
   245	
   246	## Key Rules Reminders
   247	
   248	**LONG REST BENEFITS (when Eden completes his sleep):**
   249	- Regain all HP
   250	- Regain all spell slots
   251	- Can change prepared spells
   252	- Arcane Recovery available again
   253	
   254	**FAMILIAR MECHANICS:**
   255	- Fang can act independently but Eden controls him
   256	- Can see/hear through Fang within 100 ft (action to share senses)
   257	- If Fang dies: 10d6 psychic damage, can resummon with 1-hour ritual + 10gp materials
   258	- Fang has his own initiative, low HP, can Help action or scout
   259	
   260	**RITUAL CASTING:**
   261	- Detect Magic, Identify, Comprehend Languages, Find Familiar
   262	- Takes 10 extra minutes beyond normal casting time
   263	- Doesn't expend spell slots
   264	- Can be interrupted
   265	
   266	**PLANAR ENTITY CONSIDERATIONS:**
   267	- Holy symbols provide protection/advantage
   268	- Consecrated ground limits planar movement
   269	- Lesser fiends (imps/quasits) don't have truesight - smoke/flash work
   270	- Greater fiends rare and expensive to summon
   271	- Banishment, Protection from Evil/Good, Magic Circle are effective counters
   272	
   273	## DM's Opening Options for Session 8
   274	
   275	**OPTION A - PEACEFUL WAKE:**
   276	Eden wakes naturally around midday, rested and restored. Reports are waiting: operations running smoothly, father secured, no cultist activity detected yet. Calm before the storm.
   277	
   278	**OPTION B - URGENT WAKE:**
   279	Sergeant Thorne wakes Eden earlier - the Rookery has made contact, wants to negotiate immediately. Time-sensitive opportunity.
   280	
   281	**OPTION C - CRISIS WAKE:**
   282	Wex bursts in - the cultists just attempted the kidnapping, found Aldrin gone, and now there's chaos at the secured residence wing. They're escalating.
   283	
   284	**OPTION D - MYSTERIOUS WAKE:**
   285	Eden wakes to find a raven perched on his windowsill with a message tied to its leg. The Rookery's calling card.
   286	
   287	**OPTION E - PLAYER CHOICE:**
   288	Ask the player: "How long does Eden sleep, and what would you like to focus on when he wakes?"
   289	
   290	---
   291	
   292	**SESSION 8 READY TO BEGIN!**
   293	
   294	The pieces are in position. The cultists don't know their plan is already countered. The Rookery is watching. Bhaal's exarchs are patient... for now. And Eden Sagebough, investigator and orchestrator, is about to wake into the penultimate day before everything comes to a head.
   295	
   296	What happens next?
