# Session 10 Summary
**Campaign**: The Thornhaven Shadow Crisis (Royal Court Arc)  
**Session Date**: 2026-02-18  
**In-Game Date**: Day 8 (morning, post-extraction downtime)  
**Session Length**: Tormund mentorship and magical study

---

## Session Recap

Session 10 was a quieter, more contemplative session focused on Eden's magical education and processing the aftermath of the pocket realm extraction. After two weeks of constant crisis management, Eden finally had time to study under Tormund's guidance, learning second-level spells and the fundamental principles of divination magic.

### The Morning After

**Day 8, Morning**

Eden woke after actually sleeping - eight hours, first time in two weeks. No cultists, no thresholds, no exarchs. Just rest.

A note from Tormund under the door: *"My study. Ninth bell. Bring your spellbook and the questions you're too tired to ask yet."*

### Tormund's Assessment

Tormund was waiting, coffee already poured. His opening assessment was direct:

*"You extracted an exarch from a sixth-level caster's pocket realm using misdirection, borrowed artifacts, and approximately sixty seconds of operational time. That's not luck. That's not even just good tactics. That's fundamental understanding of how magic works at a level most third-year students don't reach."*

**Conclusion:** Eden is ready for second-level spells.

### The Fear Question

Before discussing new spells, Tormund asked about the moment when Vorthanis projected supernatural terror at Eden:

**Tormund:** *"What were you thinking in that exact moment when that wave of fear hit you?"*

**Eden:** *"I was standing over a vulnerable woman being abused by a being of pure evil, and it just came naturally somehow that duty was stronger than fear. Even, apparently, magical fear. 'Thought' wasn't strictly speaking a part of it."*

**Tormund's Response:** That's the key. Magical fear is just amplified natural fear. It can be overcome by something stronger - duty, purpose, certainty about what matters.

**Critical Teaching:**
*"Those aren't just emotional states, Eden. They're magical states. The Weave responds to them. Not because you're casting a spell - because you're aligned with something fundamental."*

This tied directly into why Eden is ready for divination magic specifically.

---

## Portent: Seeing Options

Tormund introduced Eden's divination school feature: **Portent**.

### How Portent Works

**Mechanics:**
- Cast a one-minute ritual at dawn
- Roll 2d20
- Those numbers become "options" the universe has provided
- During the day, can substitute either roll for any d20 roll (yours or an ally's/enemy's)
- Once used, that portent is gone
- Tomorrow, roll again

**Philosophy:**
*"The future isn't fixed. It's probability. A field of possible outcomes. Most people stumble through that field blind. Diviners see the field. We look ahead and see which possibilities are strongest. Which outcomes are already forming."*

Not changing the future - choosing which future happens from among the ones that already could.

### The Addiction Warning

**Tormund's Caution:**
*"Once you start seeing the options, you start trying to optimize them. You start thinking you can control everything. You start believing that because you saw the possibility of something going right, you can force it to happen. And that's how diviners get themselves and everyone around them killed."*

**Real-World Example:**
Professional diviners are banned from most casinos and dice halls. The Rookery has three diviners on staff - all functionally retired from active operations because they couldn't resist using Portent for personal gain.

**The Discipline:**
Not seeing the future. Not choosing outcomes. Knowing WHEN to spend that power and when to let the dice fall naturally.

### Eden's Request: A Rubric

**Eden:** *"So give me a rubric. Criteria. Something external to my own rationalization that says 'this is worth it'. Life-or-death is a good start."*

**Tormund's Response:**
This was exactly the right question to ask. He provided his personal rubric (30 years of Portent use):

**WHEN TO SPEND PORTENT:**
1. Death saves (yours or allies)
2. Mission-critical saves against catastrophic effects
3. Preventing cascading failures (the one roll that collapses everything)
4. Enemy saving throws when you NEED the spell to land

**WHEN NOT TO:**
1. Convenience
2. Social situations you could talk through
3. Minor combats
4. Anything you have backup plans for
5. "Just in case"

**The Test:** If you wouldn't spend a third-level spell slot on solving this problem, don't spend a Portent.

**EDEN'S PORTENT RULES (Simplified for Development):**
1. Someone will die if I don't use it
2. Mission fails catastrophically if I don't use it
3. That's it. Those are the only two reasons.

*"Follow that for six months. When you've used Portent a hundred times and can look back and see which uses actually mattered and which were waste, then you can develop your own rubric."*

### The Padded Room Question

**Eden:** *"What stops me from deferring all my encounters with chance until I can Portent them away? Live in a padded room, become fantastically rich taking out investments with ridiculous downside potential that never seems to materialize?"*

**Tormund's Reaction:**
*"That question is why you're going to survive this. Most students don't ask that for years."*

**Three Answers:**

1. **Practical:** Portent only works on d20 rolls (attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks). Doesn't work on damage dice, random encounters, investment returns, or whether buildings catch fire. Can't Portent your way to wealth.

2. **Magical:** The ritual requires you to be ACTIVE in the world. Portents only apply to situations you're present for, that you can perceive and interact with. Can't hide in a room and have portents affect distant events.

3. **Philosophical:** If you avoid all risk, you never make the rolls that matter. Portent isn't about avoiding chance - it's about intervening in crucial moments. Hide from risk and your portents expire unused while the world happens without you.

**The Real Trap:**
Not using Portent to avoid risk, but using Portent to TAKE risks you normally wouldn't because you think you can guarantee outcomes.

*"Walking into a sixth-level caster's realm because you saw a good roll and thought 'I can just use this if things go bad.' And then discovering that one good roll doesn't solve a complex tactical situation."*

---

## Spell Selection: Second Level

### Eden's Approach

**Philosophy Established:**
*"I have a tendency to squeeze every drop of advantage I can get out of all my options. I'd rather use a Portent to plug a hole in a sinking plan than found the entire thing on one attempt going over well, only for circumstances to prevent me from even trying."*

**Tormund's Assessment:**
*"That's remarkably mature tactical thinking for someone your age. Most diviners I've taught see Portent as a way to guarantee their plan works. You're already thinking of it as emergency contingency."*

He shared his teacher's wisdom (she died fighting a demon in Waterdeep 20 years ago):

*"A portent spent to make a good plan perfect is a portent wasted. A portent spent to save a failing plan is a portent earned. The difference is ego."*

### First Choice: Augury (Ritual)

**Eden's Logic:**
- Ritual spell (no slot cost)
- Information gathering tool
- Saves spell slots for actual casting

**Tormund's Approval:**
Extremely disciplined choice. Most students pick flashy combat spells first.

### Second Choice Consideration

**Initial Thought:** Locate Object
- Also useful for investigation
- But NOT a ritual (requires spell slot)
- Competes with first-level slots for daily use

**Eden's Question:** *"What 2nd-level spells are rituals? I can get creative."*

**Available 2nd-Level Rituals:**
- Augury (Divination) - yes/no future questions
- Find Traps (Divination) - detects but doesn't locate/identify
- Gentle Repose (Necromancy) - preserves corpses
- Magic Mouth (Illusion) - triggered messages
- Skywrite (Transmutation) - cloud writing

**Eden's Reaction:**
Oddly drawn to Magic Mouth and Skywrite - non-standard information delivery methods. But lacked direct combat utility.

**Tormund's Guidance:**
At second level, Augury is the only really good ritual option for Eden's style. Second spell should be about tactical utility.

### Second Choice: Flaming Sphere

**Options Presented:**
- Scorching Ray (high damage, attack rolls, can miss)
- Shatter (AoE, good vs groups)
- Flaming Sphere (mobile, area denial, bonus action control)
- Cloud of Daggers (area denial, static)
- Hold Person (disable, not damage - what Vorthanis used)

**Eden's Choice:** Flaming Sphere
*"I like Flaming Sphere as a good all-rounder. Can create area denial with clever movement, but can also be used for personal defense. Requires concentration, but that's an operational consideration that can be worked in."*

**Tormund's Approval:**
- Versatile, mobile, doesn't require attack rolls
- Already thinking about concentration management (third-year level thinking)
- Bonus action control doesn't compete with main action spellcasting
- Creates visible signal ("Eden's here and active") for team coordination
- Fits operational profile: create threat/control space, then use main actions for other spells

**Concentration Mechanics Clarified:**
- Can maintain concentration AND cast other non-concentration spells
- Can't have Flaming Sphere AND Hold Person both active
- Turn 1: Cast Flaming Sphere (action), maintain concentration
- Turn 2: Cast Magic Missile (action) + move sphere (bonus action) + maintain concentration
- Turn 3: Shield (reaction when hit) + move sphere (bonus action) + maintain concentration

**Material Components:**
Flaming Sphere requires: bit of tallow, pinch of brimstone, pinch of powdered iron. Keep in component pouch.

### Final Spell Selection
1. **Augury** (Divination, ritual)
2. **Flaming Sphere** (Conjuration, concentration)

## Augury Testing: Three Scenarios

Tormund set up three real scenarios Eden would face in the next 48 hours. Each envelope contained an actual decision, not a hypothetical.

### Core Principles of Augury Questions

**What Makes Questions Answerable:**
1. Yes/no questions only
2. Short-term questions only (next 30 minutes ideally)
3. Specific enough that circumstances don't shift before you can act
4. Not strategic ("should I do this?") but tactical ("is this specific action dangerous?")

**The Weave's Answers:**
- **Weal** - Good outcome
- **Woe** - Bad outcome  
- **Weal and Woe** - Both/complicated
- **Nothing** - Too unpredictable or vague

**Key Limitation:**
Augury isn't a planning tool. It's a danger detection tool. It tells you if the NEXT STEP is dangerous, not whether the ENTIRE PATH is wise.

---

### Scenario One: Aldrin's Surveillance Records

**The Situation:**
Aldrin has 37 years of surveillance detection records disguised as volume 6 of *Planar Taxonomies* on his third shelf. These show everyone who attempted to magically eavesdrop on his warded meeting room since 1289.

Reading them would give significant intelligence but might also:
- Damage trust in current allies
- Create obligations Eden isn't ready for
- Put him in danger from factions that don't know he exists yet

**Decision:** Should Eden read the records in his 48-hour off-duty period?

**Eden's First Attempt:**
*"Will reading my father's surveillance file be a net benefit to my service to the Crown?"*

**Tormund's Critique:**
Asking for cost-benefit analysis. The Weave doesn't do math. "Net benefit to Crown service" - how does it calculate short vs. long-term, emotional state vs. intelligence value, whether the Crown wants Eden to know?

This gets "Nothing" - too vague, too many variables, too much timeframe.

**The Reframe:**
Not "should I do this thing?" but "if I do this specific thing in this timeframe, will this specific bad thing happen?"

Augury tells you if the next step is dangerous, not whether the entire path is wise.

**Better Phrasing:**
*"If I go to my father's house right now and read the first page of those records, will I trigger an immediate hostile response?"*

**Eden's Insight: Arranged Conclusions Applied to Divination**

This was the breakthrough moment:

**Eden:** *"OK...so I arrange my circumstances such that the long term is reliably predicted in the short term via standard 'arranged conclusion' methods, and then 'hook' the short-term signal with Augury. That might not work for this specific scenario, but I'm starting to see the strategy."*

**Tormund's Reaction:**
Went absolutely still. Then laughed loud enough to echo.

*"Gods. You just described exactly what master-level diviners do and you've never cast the spell once."*

**The Master Technique:**
You engineer situations where the near-term outcome is a RELIABLE SIGNAL of the long-term consequence. Then you use Augury on the signal.

**Example:**
Want to know if a merchant is trustworthy for long-term partnership? Can't ask "Will this merchant betray me eventually" (too far out). But you CAN arrange a small test transaction in the next hour where betrayal would be immediately evident. Ask: "If I give this merchant 10 gold to hold right now, will I get it back?"

If Woe - not trustworthy even in small things. If Weal - passes immediate test.

**Tormund:**
*"That's 'arranged conclusions' applied to divination magic. You're not predicting the future - you're structuring the present so the future reveals itself in predictable ways. Your father built you well. That's intelligence tradecraft applied to magical theory."*

**Eden's Refinement:**
*"Can I drop 'hostilely'? I'd want to know if anyone reacts to something which should by all means be private activity."*

**Final Question:**
*"If I pick up volume 6 of Planar Taxonomies from my father's study in the next hour, will anyone or anything react to that action?"*

**Tormund's Note:**
Very sensitive question. "Anyone or anything" includes father noticing book moved, servants walking in, magical alarms. Might get "Both" because something reacts but it's not necessarily dangerous. Trade-off: narrow too much and miss threats, broaden too much and get noise.

**RESULT: WEAL AND WOE**

Both good and something bad. The action will work but there's a cost.

**Interpretation:**
- Something/someone will react (not pure Weal - not completely safe)
- But it's not a simple trap (not pure Woe - not dangerous)
- Most likely: the book has protections/triggers Aldrin placed
- Probably alerts him it's been accessed
- Weal: you'll learn what you're looking for
- Woe: might reveal something you'll wish you didn't know yet, or Aldrin will want conversation about why you're reading it

**Tormund:**
*"That's how Augury works. Rarely gives you 'yes do it' or 'no don't.' Usually gives you 'complicated, think carefully.' Which is, honestly, more useful than people realize. Because now you KNOW it's complicated rather than walking in blind."*

---

### Scenario Two: Rookery Recruitment

**The Situation:**
Vane has made standing recruitment offer. The Rookery offers better pay, more operational freedom, access to their intelligence network.

However:
- Creates tension with Crown position
- Brecht has been supportive but Rookery is "consultants we occasionally work with," not formal allies
- Crown Special Investigator moonlighting would be politically complicated
- Kethris (when recovered) may also want formal coordination
- Multiple power structures competing for loyalty

Aldrin's advice: "Your independence is your power. Protect it."

Meeting with Vane scheduled for Day 9 evening to discuss terms.

**Eden's Immediate Concern:**
*"I already have a formal exclusivity contract with Blackwater, as regards my non-Crown work. I don't know if I could accept formal terms even if I wanted to."*

**Tormund's Reaction:**
*"That's... actually an excellent point I didn't consider when writing this scenario."*

Blackwater has priority access to Eden's non-Crown intelligence work. 500 gold annual retainer. Crown-endorsed contract. Formally joining Rookery might violate existing agreement.

**What Eden Actually Cares About:**
Not signing anything, but also not slamming door shut. Maintaining the relationship Vane has already proven comfortable with.

Highest priority: Vane's reaction to polite decline of formal partnership.

**Final Question:**
*"If I attend tomorrow's meeting with Vane and decline formal partnership while offering continued informal cooperation, will she respond positively?"*

**Tormund's Assessment:**
Clean. Specific action, immediate timeframe, measurable outcome. "Respond positively" interpretable but close enough - you'll know from her reaction whether relationship is intact or damaged.

**RESULT: WEAL**

Clear. Uncomplicated. Positive outcome.

**Meaning:**
Vane will take "no to formal partnership, yes to continued cooperation" well. She'll respect professional boundaries.

**Actionable Intelligence:**
Eden can walk into that meeting with a polite "no" to formal terms and the relationship survives.

**Tormund's Teaching Point:**
Notice the difference between scenarios. First: complicated, Weal and Woe. Second: straightforward, pure Weal. That tells you something about the situations themselves - father's records ARE genuinely complex with complications. Vane's response IS genuinely simple - she'll respect boundaries.

---

### Scenario Three: Vorthanis's Priorities

**The Situation:**
Vorthanis banished to Lower Planes. Will reform in hours to days (per Celeste). Knows Eden's name, knows Aldrin's name. Personal vendetta established.

No infrastructure left in capital (threshold closed, pocket realm destroyed, cult cell disrupted). But he's survived 60 years as an exarch. He will rebuild.

**Question:** Does he prioritize revenge immediately or rebuilding operation first? This affects alert levels and protection resource allocation.

**Eden's First Approach:**
*"Why not ask 'will Vorthanis make me his highest priority immediately upon reforming'? Do I need a signal of his priorities when I could just query them directly?"*

**Tormund's Analysis:**
Interesting. Issue: "immediately upon reforming" is outside 30-minute window. He hasn't reformed YET. Asking about what he'll prioritize when an event happens that might be hours/days from now.

BUT: You're asking about his CURRENT state of mind, which exists right now even if he's scattered. His priorities are forming NOW as he reconstitutes.

The Weave might interpret as asking about the present (what are his priorities right this moment) rather than predicting future behavior.

Warning: Might get Nothing because his mind is literally scattered and priorities aren't formed yet. OR might get answer because divine entities think differently and his vendetta is fundamental to his reconstitution.

**Eden's Refinement:**
*"So I'll lean into the present-tense framing. Disambiguate the question, disambiguate the answer. 'Am I in Vorthanis's top three priorities for after reformation, as he sees them right now?'"*

**Tormund's Assessment:**
*"That's... actually brilliant."*

- "Top three" instead of "highest" - actionable without requiring absolute precision
- "As he sees them right now" - anchors firmly in present
- Asks about current mental state, which exists even while reforming
- Specific enough to be meaningful (if top three → high alert; if not → he's prioritizing other things)

Warning: Weal and Woe get complicated here.
- Weal might mean "no, not top three" OR "yes, but that's good because he's underestimating you"
- Woe might mean "yes, top three" OR "no, but that's bad because he's planning something subtle"

The answer will require interpretation but you'll get an answer.

**The Casting:**
This one took longer. Could feel the Weave searching, reaching across planes to read intention and thought in something barely coherent enough to have priorities.

**RESULT: WOE**

Clear. Unambiguous. Bad news.

**Meaning:**
Eden IS in Vorthanis's top three priorities for after reformation.

**Eden:** *"Let's...let's just say, high alert."*

**Tormund's Response:**
Definitive nod. *"You're in his top three. Which means when he reforms - hours, days, however long it takes - revenge is on his immediate agenda."*

Unpleasant information, but good to have. Alternative was not knowing and getting caught unprepared in three months.

**Immediate Action:**
- Tormund will inform Brecht
- Protection detail stays active indefinitely
- Decoy operations continue
- Aldrin's security gets upgraded

*"That's what Augury is for. Not avoiding bad news - getting it early enough to act on it."*

---

## Summary of Results

**Three scenarios, three different results:**

1. **Father's Records:** Weal and Woe - complicated, proceed carefully
2. **Vane Meeting:** Weal - she'll respect professional boundaries  
3. **Vorthanis Priority:** Woe - he's coming for you specifically

**None told Eden what to DO. All gave information about immediate next steps.**

**The Gift:**
Tormund gave Eden the carved wooden sticks (Augury material components). They're his now.

**Level Up Complete:**
- Augury learned
- Flaming Sphere learned
- Portent feature acquired
- Third level achieved

---

## The Lantern Request

After learning about Vorthanis's priorities, Eden had a follow-up security concern.

**Eden:** *"Rest? REST?! An exarch of Bhaal intends to kill me personally for foiling his plans...no. Rest is unfortunately not on the table. On that point, a favor - do you think I could get my hands on a Lantern of Revealing to put in my quarters? Just to avoid any further familiar shenanigans."*

**Tormund's Analysis:**

**Lantern of Revealing:**
- Uncommon magical item
- Reveals invisible creatures/objects in 60-foot radius
- Also dispels illusions
- Worth ~500 gold (half Eden's annual income)

However: Eden just survived impossible operation and has exarch coming for him. Crown has institutional interest in keeping him alive.

Tormund has one - confiscated from smuggling operation two years ago, sitting in Royal Guard armory collecting dust.

Can authorize loan for security purposes.

**Practical Question:**
Do you want to sleep every night with a lantern that reveals EVERYTHING invisible? Every spider, dust mote, minor magical residue?

Or do you want wards on your door that alert if something invisible ENTERS? Less paranoid, more actionable.

What's actual security concern? Invisible familiars specifically? Broader infiltration? Something else?

**Eden's Clarification:**
*"I had considered wards. But wards aren't portable enough for this use case, I think. The threat model is not infiltration of my quarters specifically, but surveillance of me. I already have this anti-scrying pin (thank you for that) but there are other ways to surveil magically that this resolves. Make out the loan to my protection detail rather than me."*

**Tormund's Assessment:**
*"Smart. You're thinking about operational security, not just personal safety."*

Surveillance is bigger threat: invisible familiars, scrying sensors, magical eavesdropping constructs. Pin blocks remote scrying but doesn't stop invisible spy in corner.

**Authorization:**
- Loan authorized to protection detail
- Sergeant Valdis (or whoever's actually in charge) can carry during sensitive meetings or vulnerable locations
- Fair warning: conspicuous - people will notice, enemies will know you're looking
- But deterrence has value

**Delivery:**
Paperwork to Brecht by evening. He'll assign to detail.

---

## Tormund's Final Concern

**Tormund:** *"Anything else? Because you've now learned two spells, gained a level, discovered an exarch wants you dead, and requisitioned magical security equipment. That's a productive morning, but you're supposed to be resting."*

Pause.

*"When's the last time you actually slept more than four hours without planning an operation or processing a crisis?"*

**Eden:** *"Going on two weeks ago. I'll try, Tormund. I'll try."*

**Tormund's Order:**
*"Two weeks. You're twenty years old, Eden. Your body can survive that. Your judgment can't."*

Not a suggestion - an order from his mentor:
- Go to quarters
- Sleep actual sleep, not "lying down while mentally cataloguing threats"
- If brain won't stop, Temple makes tea (valerian root and chamomile, not magical, just effective)
- Will have some sent to room

**Final Words:**
*"Vorthanis is coming for you. That's true. It's also true that you'll face him better rested than exhausted. The Lantern will be with your detail by evening. Brecht knows about the threat. Your father is secured. You have 48 hours off-duty."*

*"Use at least 12 of them unconscious. That's not optional."*

*"Dismissed, Special Investigator. Go be a twenty-year-old who survived the impossible and needs a nap."*

---

## Character Development

### Eden's Magical Philosophy

**Portent as Contingency, Not Foundation:**
Eden immediately understood the correct approach to Portent - use it to plug holes in plans, not to build plans around. This is master-level thinking that most students take years to develop.

Quote from Tormund's dead teacher: *"A portent spent to make a good plan perfect is a portent wasted. A portent spent to save a failing plan is a portent earned. The difference is ego."*

**Resource Efficiency:**
Strong preference for ritual spells to preserve spell slots. Chose Augury specifically because it rituals well. Only picked Flaming Sphere (non-ritual) after confirming Augury was the only good second-level ritual option.

**Arranged Conclusions + Divination:**
Eden independently discovered the master technique of engineering test situations where near-term signals reliably indicate long-term consequences, then using Augury to read those signals. This synthesis of intelligence tradecraft and magical theory impressed Tormund significantly.

**Operational Security Thinking:**
Not just personal safety but surveillance as primary threat model. Understanding that anti-scrying pin doesn't cover all magical surveillance methods. Assigning Lantern to protection detail rather than keeping it personally for broader coverage and deterrence value.

### Fear and Certainty

The conversation about the fear save revealed Eden's fundamental approach:

**Not about bravery** - acknowledging fear exists
**About alignment** - being certain about what matters (duty, protecting vulnerable, preventing mass casualties)
**Magical significance** - the Weave responds to certainty as a magical state, not just emotional one

This connects to his divination specialty: seeing options clearly, choosing with certainty, not being paralyzed by possibility.

### Sleep Deprivation

**Two weeks** without more than 4 hours of sleep while planning operations or processing crises.

Age 20. Body can survive it. Judgment can't.

Tormund's order to use 12 of 48 off-duty hours unconscious is the first time someone's explicitly told Eden to stop and rest.

### The Discipline Question

Eden asking for external rubrics rather than trusting his own rationalization shows mature self-awareness. Knows his tendency to optimize and squeeze every advantage. Requesting guardrails before he has the power to abuse.

---

## Themes Explored

### Information as Power (Continued)

Augury fits Eden's emerging "librarian" role perfectly:
- Information gathering without slot cost
- Tactical intelligence about immediate next steps
- Doesn't solve problems, reveals context to solve them intelligently
- Non-flashy but invaluable in field operations

Flaming Sphere also fits: creates visible signal for team coordination while maintaining tactical flexibility.

### The Addiction to Control

Entire Portent discussion centered on how seeing power creates temptation to use it. Professional diviners banned from casinos. Rookery diviners retired because they couldn't resist optimizing for personal gain.

Eden's request for rubrics and Tormund's strict initial guidelines (only two reasons to use Portent) establish healthy relationship with power before Eden has chance to develop bad habits.

### Master-Level Thinking in Novice Context

Multiple times Tormund noted Eden displaying "third-year thinking" or "master-level" approaches:
- Concentration management as operational consideration
- Portent as contingency not foundation
- Arranged conclusions + divination synthesis
- Asking for rubrics to prevent rationalization

This validates the 20-year preparation arc while showing Eden still has massive amount to learn.

### Strategic vs. Tactical Questions

Core teaching of Augury: difference between "should I do this?" (strategic, unanswerable) and "is this specific next step dangerous?" (tactical, answerable).

Applies to life generally: can't predict whether entire path is wise, but can check if next step is safe before taking it.

---

## Magic Learned

### Portent (Divination School Feature - Level 3)

**Mechanics:**
- Cast 1-minute ritual at dawn
- Roll 2d20
- Can replace any d20 roll during the day with either number
- Once used, that portent is gone
- Reset at next dawn

**Philosophy:**
Not predicting future. Seeing field of possible outcomes and choosing which becomes real.

**Discipline:**
Limited uses (2 per day). Requires wisdom about when to spend vs. when to let dice fall naturally.

**Eden's Rules (6-month development period):**
1. Someone will die if I don't use it
2. Mission fails catastrophically if I don't use it
3. That's it

### Augury (2nd-Level Divination Ritual)

**Mechanics:**
- 1-minute ritual casting
- Material component: carved sticks or bones
- Ask yes/no question about action in next 30 minutes
- Weave answers: Weal, Woe, Both, or Nothing

**Usage:**
- Specific actions in near-term timeframe
- NOT: "Should I open this door?" (too vague)
- YES: "If I open this door in the next 5 minutes, will it trigger a trap?"
- Danger detection tool, not planning tool

**Master Technique:**
Engineer test situations where near-term outcome reliably signals long-term consequence. Use Augury on the signal rather than asking about distant future directly.

### Flaming Sphere (2nd-Level Conjuration)

**Mechanics:**
- Action to cast, creates 5-foot diameter ball of fire
- 2d6 fire damage, DEX save for half
- Concentration (1 minute duration)
- Bonus action to move 30 feet and ram into enemies
- Material components: tallow, brimstone, powdered iron

**Tactical Uses:**
- Mobile area denial
- Personal defense
- Team coordination signal (visible to allies)
- Doesn't compete with main action spellcasting
- Requires concentration (can't stack with other concentration spells)

---

**Authorization:**
- Confiscated from smuggling operation (Royal Guard armory)
- Loaned for security purposes given exarch threat
- Assigned to protection detail (Sergeant Valdis or equivalent)
- Use during sensitive meetings or vulnerable locations

**Trade-offs:**
- Conspicuous (people notice it, enemies know you're looking)
- Deterrence value
- Portable unlike wards
- Addresses surveillance threat model

### Augury Components

Carved wooden sticks with magical symbols. Given to Eden by Tormund. Part of permanent spell component kit.

### Spell Material Components

Need to acquire/maintain:
- Tallow, brimstone, powdered iron (for Flaming Sphere)

---

## Plot Threads

### Immediate Actions Triggered

**From Augury Results:**

1. **Father's Records (Weal and Woe):**
   - Proceed carefully if/when reading
   - Something will react (likely Aldrin being notified)
   - Will learn valuable information but with complications

2. **Vane Meeting (Weal):**
   - Safe to decline formal partnership
   - Offer continued informal cooperation
   - Relationship will survive
   - Meeting scheduled Day 9 evening

3. **Vorthanis Priority (Woe):**
   - Confirmed: Eden is top 3 priorities
   - Tormund informing Brecht
   - Protection detail staying active indefinitely
   - Aldrin's security being upgraded
   - Decoy operations continuing
   - High alert status

**From Tormund:**
- Lantern of Revealing being delivered to Brecht by evening
- Valerian/chamomile tea being sent to Eden's quarters
- Mandate: 12+ hours sleep in next 48 hours

### Advanced

**Eden's Development:**
- Level 3 achieved
- Divination specialization formalized
- Portent discipline being established
- Sleep deprivation reaching critical point

**Vorthanis Threat:**
- Revenge is immediate priority (confirmed)
- Will surface when reformation complete (hours to days)
- No infrastructure but 60 years of survival experience
- Personal vendetta against Eden and Aldrin

### Opened

**48-Hour Downtime Remaining Activities:**

- Shared personal teacher's journal (she died 20 years ago)
- Gave Eden permanent material components (carved sticks)

**Recognition of Eden's capabilities:**

- "That question is why you're going to survive this"

**Ongoing mentorship:**
- Expects Eden to practice and develop
- Will check on Portent discipline over time

- Balancing teaching with operational support

- 60 years of exarch survival experience
- Currently scattered but reconstituting

**Timeline:**

- Unknown which approach he'll take

## Key Quotes

**On Fear and Magic:**
*"Those aren't just emotional states, Eden. They're magical states. The Weave responds to them. Not because you're casting a spell - because you're aligned with something fundamental."* - Tormund

**On Divination:**
*"The future isn't fixed. It's probability. A field of possible outcomes. Most people stumble through that field blind. Diviners see the field."* - Tormund

**On Portent Discipline:**
*"Once you start seeing the options, you start trying to optimize them. You start thinking you can control everything. And that's how diviners get themselves and everyone around them killed."* - Tormund

**Master Technique:**
*"That's 'arranged conclusions' applied to divination magic. You're not predicting the future - you're structuring the present so the future reveals itself in predictable ways. Your father built you well. That's intelligence tradecraft applied to magical theory."* - Tormund

**On Augury:**
*"Not avoiding bad news - getting it early enough to act on it."* - Tormund

**Dead Teacher's Wisdom:**
*"A portent spent to make a good plan perfect is a portent wasted. A portent spent to save a failing plan is a portent earned. The difference is ego."*

**On Rest:**
*"You're twenty years old, Eden. Your body can survive that. Your judgment can't."* - Tormund

**Final Dismissal:**
*"Go be a twenty-year-old who survived the impossible and needs a nap."* - Tormund
