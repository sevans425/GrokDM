     4	
     5	## Session Recap
     6	
     7	Session 7 was a masterclass in intelligence operations and tactical thinking. Eden transformed from reactive investigator into proactive orchestrator, running multiple simultaneous operations while managing threats to himself and his loved ones.
     8	
     9	The session opened with Eden discovering an **invisible familiar** spying in his quarters—a rat using permanent invisibility magic to observe his spellbook and activities. Rather than simply killing it, Eden captured it and used the opportunity to send a message to its caster (likely the Rookery): "Talk to the people wearing copper bracelets. They'll make it worth your while." This brilliant bit of improvisation turned a security breach into a potential recruitment opportunity.
    10	
    11	Eden then met secretly with **Miriam Crowsinger**, who revealed unsettling news: someone was using **planar scrying magic** (likely from the Lower Planes) to monitor anyone consulting with her. Through careful analysis, Eden and Miriam concluded this was probably **Bhaal's own exarch or divine servants**—not a separate faction, but the death god's remaining power structure directly overseeing the assassination operation. Miriam provided a book on planar entities and warned Eden that whatever he stopped in Thornhaven might have been more significant than he realized. Why would a dead god invest this much attention in killing one 20-year-old investigator?
    12	
    13	Understanding the planar threat, Eden made a crucial decision: **obtain holy symbols for his entire team**. He couldn't explain *why* without revealing what he knew (and potentially alerting the watchers), so he framed it as reasonable precaution against "death cultists with necromancy." High Priestess Celeste provided consecrated symbols of Helm—protection against both undead and planar entities. Eden also acquired tactical supplies from Tormund: scrolls of Disguise Self (concealed in his boot linings), smoke pellets, and flash powder for emergency extraction.
    14	
    15	The **midnight infiltration of the boarding house** was executed flawlessly. Disguised as drunk dockworkers, Eden and his protection detail (Sergeant Thorne, Greyson, and newcomer Private Alden) rented rooms on the first floor—one floor below the cultists. Eden deployed Fang into the rafters above Room 9, where he observed and overheard a critical conversation:
    16	
    17	**The cultists know about the decoy operation.** They've identified it as body doubles with fake familiar bonds, but they're paralyzed with indecision—unable to determine which target is real, unable to strike without risking capture. Frustrated and desperate, **Subject Three (the leader) proposed a new plan: kidnap Eden's father Aldrin tonight (Day 7) and use him as bait.** "Come alone or your father dies."
    18	
    19	Fang also observed an **active blood ritual circle** in their room, multiple necromantic talismans, poisoned weapons, and detected a disturbing sulfurous smell—signs of possible planar preparation or presence.
    20	
    21	Eden successfully extracted Fang and his team at dawn, returning to the palace with game-changing intelligence. In the briefing with Commander Brecht, Eden demonstrated exceptional tactical thinking by asking: **"What's their backup plan?"** If they can't reach Eden (decoys) or his father (about to be secured), where do they go next?
    22	
    23	This analysis led to protective measures for multiple potential targets: **Professor Verin** (assigned discrete guard), **Magistrate Kellan** (threat briefing), and most critically, **Commander Rorick Stoneshield**—traveling between cities, personally significant to Eden, and vulnerable to ambush by surviving Thornhaven cultists. Eden sent a warning via Sending spell, and Rorick confirmed he'd go to ground and rally Thornhaven's militia.
    24	
    25	**Aldrin Sagebough** was immediately relocated to the secured residence wing with heavy guard, completely countering the cultists' Day 7 kidnapping plan before they could even attempt it.
    26	
    27	During the carriage ride back, exhausted and stressed, Eden briefly entertained the idea of **burning down the boarding house** with the cultists inside—hypothetically arranging for all other guests to be conveniently absent. Sergeant Thorne didn't react with horror (the tactical logic was sound), but gently reminded Eden that such actions would change who he is. Eden ultimately rejected the plan, recognizing it as desperation rather than strategy, though he noted darkly that if the cultists' ritual accidentally summoned something that burned the place down with hellfire... well, that would just be natural consequences.
    28	
    29	The session ended with Eden collapsing into exhausted sleep, having run operations continuously for over 24 hours, while his protection measures deployed across the capital.

   130	## Next Session Preview
   131	
   132	**Day 7 continues...** Eden sleeps while his carefully laid protections deploy across the capital. But the cultists don't know their Day 7 plan is already countered. What happens when they attempt the kidnapping and find Aldrin Sagebough gone? How will they react to yet another failure?
   133	
   134	The **Rookery** has had nearly a full day to observe the copper bracelet signal spreading across palace guards and Blackwater's network. Will they make contact? What price will they demand for cooperation?
   135	
   136	The **captured invisible familiar** remains contained in Eden's quarters. Its caster knows it's missing. Will they negotiate, attempt retrieval, or simply dismiss and resummon?
   137	
   138	And looming over everything: the **planar presence**. Bhaal's exarchs watching through scrying, the sulfurous smell in the cultists' room, the active blood ritual circle. How long before divine patience runs out and something from the Lower Planes manifests directly?
   139	
   140	**Day 8 and Day 9 approach.** The cultists are desperate, cornered, and backed by a murder god who demands results. The final confrontation is coming.
   141	
   142	The question is: will Eden get to choose the battlefield, or will the cultists' desperation force his hand?
   143
