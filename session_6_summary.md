     9	## Session Recap
    10	
    11	Session 6 marked a significant transition for Eden Sagebough from reactive hero to proactive investigator. After the intense political maneuvering of Session 5, Eden spent Day 5 building systems, establishing mentorships, and turning the Bhaal cultist threat from a defensive crisis into an offensive trap.
    12	
    13	### Morning: The Watcher in the Gardens
    14	
    15	The session opened with Eden's first morning as Special Investigator to the Crown. Rather than ceremonial meetings, Eden immediately began delegating tasks over breakfast:
    16	- Tasked his father Aldrin with finding an Archives scholar to help with magical theory
    17	- Planned to have Magistrate Kellan finalize the Blackwater contract
    18	
    19	Before he could finish breakfast with Kellan, **Fang detected a hostile presence** in the palace gardens. Eden cast *Detect Magic* (ritual) and discovered a professional surveillance operative watching the eastern solar. The watcher radiated:
    20	- **Necromancy aura** (moderate) - likely a Bhaal-blessed item or ritual
    21	- **Illusion aura** (faint) - magical disguise or concealment
    22	- **Bone talisman** wrapped in black cloth at his belt
    23	
    24	The cultist escaped over the garden wall when palace security responded, but Eden gained critical intelligence about the threat level.
    25	
    26	### The Emergency Council
    27	
    28	King Aldric III convened an immediate security meeting with:
    29	- Commander Brecht (Royal Guard)
    30	- High Priestess Celeste (Temple of Helm)
    31	- Archmage Tormund
    32	- Captain Henrik Thorne (Captain of the Guard)
    33	
    34	Eden proposed a **tactical counter-operation using decoys**:
    35	- Three body doubles matching his appearance
    36	- Each equipped with enchanted bracelets creating false familiar-bond signatures
    37	- Protected by 4-guard details + Temple clerics
    38	- Following predictable patterns to draw out cultist attacks
    39	- Forcing the three cultists to spread resources or risk striking the wrong target
    40	
    41	The King approved immediately, impressed by Eden's tactical thinking. The operation would begin at dawn Day 6.
    42	
    43	### Formalizing the Blackwater Partnership
    44	
    45	With royal endorsement, Eden and Cornelius Blackwater signed a consultation agreement:
    46	- **500 gold annual retainer** for priority access to Eden's expertise
    47	- **Mutual intelligence sharing** via tiered confidentiality system
    48	- **Crown endorsement** giving the partnership official status
    49	- **Emergency provisions** activating Blackwater's network immediately to hunt cultists
    50	
    51	Within hours, Blackwater's 20+ informants throughout the capital identified:
    52	- **Three separate sightings** of individuals matching cultist profiles
    53	- **Suspicious alchemical purchases** (poisons/incendiaries)
    54	- **Confirmed boarding house location** in Dock Ward where three cultists were staying
    55	
    56	Rather than raiding immediately, Eden proposed **sleep deprivation tactics**: Blackwater's people would create construction noise and merchant activity around the boarding house, preventing the cultists from resting. Exhausted cultists would make mistakes, giving the decoy operation better chances of success.
    57	
    58	### The Archives: Building a Magical Foundation
    59	
    60	Eden spent **five hours** in the Royal Archives studying the *Principia Arcana* (Tormund's first-year Academy text) and Tormund's personal study journal. He completed the three foundational chapters:
    61	
    62	1. **The Nature of the Weave** - Magic as a fundamental force to be shaped, not created
    63	2. **Intent and Formula** - How precise spellcasting and will work together
    64	3. **The Eight Schools** - Metaphysical distinctions between magical disciplines
    65	
    66	Eden met **Professor Thaddeus Verin**, a semi-retired divination specialist who offered to mentor him. Eden identified his magical specialization interests:
    67	- **Major: Divination** - The investigator's school, gathering information through magic
    68	- **Minor: Illusion** - Disseminating false information to complement gathered truth
    69	
    70	Verin explained that divination requires clarity of question, openness to answers, and comfort with uncertainty—challenging for someone like Eden who prefers control, but perfectly suited to his investigative nature.
    71	
    72	Tormund's journal revealed his weakness was divination (he preferred imposing will over listening to reality), suggesting Eden might actually excel where his mentor struggled.
    73	
    74	### Evening: Rest Before the Storm
    75	
    76	With multiple operations in motion, Eden finally rested:
    77	- **Decoy operation** ready to launch at dawn
    78	- **Sleep deprivation operation** beginning morning Day 6
    79	- **Boarding house surveillance** ongoing
    80	- **Palace security** tripled and randomized
    81	- **Enchanted bracelets** being crafted overnight by Tormund
    82	- **Intelligence network** actively hunting cultists
    83	
    84	Eden went to sleep well-protected, having transformed from hunted target to orchestrator of a comprehensive trap.
    85	
    86	---
    87	
    88	## Key Events

   193	
   194	## Session Themes
   195	
   196	### "Building the Framework"
   197	Both magical and tactical frameworks established:
   198	- Magical: Understanding *why* spells work, not just *how*
   199	- Tactical: Creating systems that work even if Eden isn't perfect
   200	- Social: Delegating to experts and building trust networks
   201	- Strategic: Long-term thinking over short-term reactions
   202	
   203	### Patience vs. Action
   204	Eden demonstrated comfort with patient, methodical approaches:
   205	- Surveillance rather than immediate raid
   206	- Sleep deprivation rather than direct confrontation
   207	- Study sessions rather than rushing into danger
   208	- System-building rather than heroic solo efforts
   209	
   210	### The Investigator's Toolkit
   211	Eden identifying divination and illusion as his specialties reflects his core identity:
   212	- Gathering truth (divination)
   213	- Disseminating falsehood (illusion)
   214	- Information warfare over direct combat
   215	- Prediction and preparation over reaction
   216	
   217	---
   218	
   219	## Memorable Moments
   220	
   221	**"Decorations"**
   222	Eden's dismissive comment about palace guards being "almost like decorations" showed his pragmatic view of resources and willingness to leverage available assets.
   223	
   224	**The Coffee Offering**
   225	Eden offering Tormund coffee or tea—a small gesture that caught the Archmage off-guard and demonstrated Eden's growing social sophistication.
   226	
   227	**Fang the Vigilant**
   228	The familiar detecting the cultist surveillance before anyone else, proving yet again why the rat familiar is invaluable.
   229	
   230	**"Maybe major in Divination, minor in Illusion"**
   231	Eden casually identifying his magical specialization path after five hours of study, already thinking strategically about his education.
   232	
   233	**The John Hancock**
   234	Eden signing the Blackwater contract with theatrical flourish "just slightly smaller than Blackwater's"—diplomatic even in penmanship.
   235	
   236	**Sleep Deprivation Tactics**
   237	Eden's suggestion to exhaust the cultists through manufactured noise operations showed creative tactical thinking beyond direct confrontation.
   238	
   239	---
   240	
   241	## DM Notes
   242	
   243	### What Worked Well
   244	- Player engagement with magical theory and framework-building
   245	- Tactical planning felt earned and well-reasoned
   246	- Delegation and system-building matched character growth
   247	- Balance between action (cultist threat) and development (study, relationships)
   248	- Natural transition from reactive to proactive posture
   249	
   250	### Character Consistency
   251	- Eden's stated "I hate politics" paradox continues (exhausted by it, excellent at it)
   252	- Preference for systems and predictability over chaos
   253	- Investigative approach to magic (wanting to understand theory)
   254	- Tactical thinking applied to non-combat situations
   255	- Delegation as coping mechanism for overwhelming responsibility
   256	
   257	### Pacing
   258	- Session had good rhythm: crisis → planning → study → rest
   259	- No combat this session—entirely social/intellectual
   260	- Cultist threat provides tension without requiring immediate action
   261	- Multiple operations in motion create forward momentum for Session 7
   262	
   263	### Player Agency
   264	- Player drove all major decisions (decoy strategy, sleep deprivation, study focus, divination specialization)
   265	- Felt in control despite being hunted by death cultists
   266	- Built solutions that matched character's strengths and preferences
   267	
   268	---
   269	
   270	## Next Session Preview
   271	
   272	**Session 7 will open at dawn, Day 6:**
   273	
   274	**Immediate Situations:**
   275	- Decoy operations beginning (three body doubles with enchanted bracelets)
   276	- Sleep deprivation operation starting at boarding house
   277	- First day of sustained counter-operation against cultists
   278	- Continued magical study opportunities
   279	
   280	**Potential Developments:**
   281	- Cultist attempt on a decoy (or Eden himself)
   282	- Effects of exhaustion on cultist decision-making
   283	- Intelligence reports from Blackwater's network
   284	- Continued Principia Arcana study
   285	- First practical divination lesson with Professor Verin?
   286	- Protection detail becoming routine part of life
   287	
   288	**Key Questions:**
   289	- Will the cultists recognize the decoy trap?
   290	- How quickly does sleep deprivation degrade their effectiveness?
   291	- Does Eden continue studying or get pulled into action?
   292	- What intelligence does Blackwater's network uncover?
   293	- Do the cultists have contingencies of their own?
